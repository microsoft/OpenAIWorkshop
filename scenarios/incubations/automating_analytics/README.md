# Overview
This application demonstrates the of Open AI (ChatGPT/GPT-4) to help answer business questions by performing advanced data analytic tasks on a business database.
Examples of questions are:
- Simple: Show me daily revenue trends in 2016  per region
- More difficult: Is that true that top 20% customers generate 80% revenue in 2016?
- Advanced: Forecast monthly revenue for next 12 months starting from June-2018

The application supports Python's built-in SQLITE as well as your own Microsoft SQL Server.
# Quick start with hosted demo application 
1. Go to our hosted demo at https://app-web-ulajovkr7vyd4.azurewebsites.net/ if you do not want to install yourself.
3. Enter Open AI and database settings if these were not done during installation (see installation below if you want to install yourself).

    Click on settings. Provide Open AI keys, deployment name and URL for ChatGPT. Optionally, you can provide deployment name for GPT-4 for advanced questions.
    For data, you can use the built-in SQLITE demo dataset or you can choose to specify your own SQL Server. In case you use SQLITE, you don't need to enter details for SQL Server.
    Click on submit to save settings.
3. There are two applications
    - SQL Query Writing Assistant: a simple application that translate business question into SQL query language then execute and display result.
    - Data Analysis Assistant: a more sophisticated application to perform advanced data analytics such as statisical analysis and forecasting. Here we demonstrate the use of [Chain of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) and [React](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) techniques to perform multi-step processing where the next step in the chain also depends on the observation/result from the previous step. 
4. Use SQL Query Writing Assistant
    
     <img width="1159" alt="image" src="../../../documents/media/da_assistant2.png">
    
    - Use a question from the FAQ or enter your own question.
    - You can select ```show code``` and/or ```show prompt``` to show SQL query and the prompt behind the scene.
    - Click on submit to execute and see result.
4. Use Data Ananalyst Assistant
    
     <img width="1159" alt="image" src="../../../documents/media/da_assistant3.png">
    
    - Use a question from the FAQ or enter your own question.
    - You can select ```show code``` and/or ```show prompt``` to show SQL & Python code and  the prompt behind the scene.
    - Click on submit to execute and see result.
    - For advanced questions such as forecasting, you can use GPT-4 as the engine

# Installation 
## Open AI setup
1. Create an Azure OpenAI deployment in an Azure subscription with a GPT-35-Turbo deployment and preferably a GPT-4 deployment.
Here we provide options to use both but GPT-4 should be used to address difficult & vague  questions.
We assume that your GPT-4 and CHATGPT deployments are in the same Azure OpenAI resource.
## Install the application locally 
1. Clone the repo (e.g. ```git clone https://github.com/microsoft/OpenAIWorkshop.git``` or download). Then navigate to ```cd scenarios/incubations/automating_analytics```
2. (Optional) Provide settings for Open AI and Database.You can either create a `secrets.env` file in the root of this folder (scenarios/incubations/automating_analytics) as below or do it using the app's UI later on. 
    - Option 1: use built-in SQLITE. Then you don't need to install SQL Server.
        ```txt
        AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="9999999999999999999999999"
        AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4_DEPLOYMENT="NAME_OF_GPT_4_DEPLOYMENT"
        AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT="NAME_OF_CHATGPT_4_DEPLOYMENT"
        AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://openairesourcename.openai.azure.com/
        SQL_ENGINE = "sqlite"
        ```
    - Option 2: use your own SQL Server

        ```txt
        AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="9999999999999999999999999"
        AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://openairesourcename.openai.azure.com/"
        AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4_DEPLOYMENT="NAME_OF_GPT_4_DEPLOYMENT"
        AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT="NAME_OF_CHATGPT_4_DEPLOYMENT"
        SQL_USER="sqluserid"
        SQL_PASSWORD="sqlpassword"
        SQL_DATABASE="WideWorldImportersDW"
        SQL_SERVER="sqlservername.database.windows.net"
        ```

3. Navigate to ```cd scenarios/incubations/automating_analytics```
4. Create a python environment with version from 3.7 and 3.10
    - [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
        - **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`. 
5. Import the requirements.txt `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. To run the application from the command line: `streamlit run app.py`
7. The UI prompts for settings. If you want to save these so the next time you run the project you don't have to type them in, you can create a `secrets.env` file in the root of streamlit folder
8. If you are a Mac user, please follow [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/install-microsoft-odbc-driver-sql-server-macos?view=sql-server-ver16) to install ODBC for PYODBC
## Deploy the application to Azure 
This application can be deployed to an Azure subscription using the Azure Developer CLI. 
There is no need to have any coding experience to deploy this application but you will need permissions to create resources in an Azure Subscription
To deploy to Azure:
- Install [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)   
- Use either `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/OpenAIWorkshop.git` to clone the repo or download a zip
- Go to the local directory of the OpenAIWorkshop
    > ðŸ’¡ NOTE: It is very important to be in the root folder of the project
- Authenticate to Azure by running `azd auth login`
- Create a local environment `azd env new`
    > ðŸ’¡ NOTE: If deploying to the same Subscription as others, use a unique name
- Deploy the app and infrastructure using `azd up`

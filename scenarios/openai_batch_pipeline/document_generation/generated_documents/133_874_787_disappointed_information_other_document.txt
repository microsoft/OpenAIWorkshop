Hello, I recently purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and I'm not very pleased with it. I'm looking for some more information about the product.

Contoso Wireless Customer Service Agent:
Hello, thank you for reaching out to Contoso Wireless. I apologize that you're not pleased with your purchase. We take customer satisfaction very seriously and would like to help you in any way we can. Could you tell me more about the product you purchased and why you're not satisfied?

Customer:
I bought the Contoso Wireless Pro and it's just not working as advertised. The battery life is shorter than promised, and it's slower than I expected. I'd like to know what other options Contoso has available that might be better for me.

Contoso Wireless Customer Service Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience. The Contoso Wireless Pro is one of our most popular models and we stand by its quality. However, if you're looking for something with improved battery life and speed, we do have several other products that may fit your needs better. Could you tell me a bit more about what kind of features you're looking for?

Customer: 
Well, I need a phone that has great battery life since I'm always on the go, plus fast processing power so I can run multiple apps at once without any slowdown. And of course, I'd prefer something that looks good too.

Contoso Wireless Customer Service Agent:
We understand your needs and appreciate your feedback. We have several models that could fit your requirements, such as the Contoso Prime or the Contoso Elite Pro. Both of these models come with extended battery life and powerful processors, as well as sleek designs. Would you like me to provide more information on either of these phones? 

Customer: 
Yes please! I'd love to hear more about them both so I can make an informed decision. 

Contoso Wireless Customer Service Agent: 
Certainly! The Contoso Prime offers an extended battery life of up to 10 hours of talk time on a single charge, plus fast processing power with an octa-core processor for smooth multitasking between apps. Additionally, it has a 5-inch HD display for crisp visuals, plus a stylish design with an aluminum finish. 

The Contoso Elite Pro also has an impressive battery life of up to 12 hours of talk time on a single charge and comes with a powerful octa-core processor for quick multitasking between apps. Plus, it has a 6-inch HD display for vivid visuals, plus a stylish design with a sleek black finish. 

Which phone would you like me to provide more information on?

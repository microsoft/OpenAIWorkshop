Hello, I'm calling about the Contoso Wireless phone I recently purchased. I have a few questions about the product.

Agent:

Hi there, my name is [Name] and I'm one of the customer service agents for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you with your phone today?

Customer:

Well, first of all, I'm disappointed that the phone doesn't seem to be working properly. When I try to make a call, it just won't connect. What can you tell me about that?

Agent: 
I apologize for any inconvenience you're experiencing with your phone. Could you please provide me with a bit more information so that I can assist you further? What kind of phone are you using and what type of connection are you attempting to make? 

Customer: 
I bought the Contoso Wireless Pro and I'm trying to make a call on the cellular network. 

Agent: 
Okay, let's take a look at this issue. Can you tell me what type of signal strength you have in your current location? Also, have you tried restarting your phone to see if that helps? 

Customer: 
The signal strength is fine, but restarting the phone didn't help at all. 

Agent: 
I understand. It sounds like we need to investigate this further. Would it be possible for me to remotely access your device so that I can take a closer look at the issue? 

Customer: 
Yes, that would be okay. How do I do that? 

Agent: 
Great! First, please download our remote access software on your device from our website. Once it's installed, let me know and I'll connect remotely and check out what's going on. 

Customer: 
Okay, got it. I'll download the software now and let you know when it's done. 

 Agent: 
Excellent! Please let me know when it's installed so that I can take a closer look at the issue and see what we can do to help resolve it for you.

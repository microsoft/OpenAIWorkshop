Customer Service Agent: Welcome to Contoso Wireless, how may I assist you?

Customer: Hi there. I just bought a new phone from your store and I'm having some trouble with it. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely. What seems to be the issue?

Customer: Well, I'm having trouble connecting to my home Wi-Fi network. It's not recognizing the password I entered. 

Customer Service Agent: That's strange. Can you tell me what model of phone you have? 

Customer: Yes, it's a Contoso 8X. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, let's take a look at your phone settings. First, can you open up the Wi-Fi settings menu on your phone? 

Customer: Yes, I did that already. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, now can you make sure that the correct password is entered into the password field for your home Wi-Fi network? 

Customer: Yes, it's the same one that I always use for my other devices and it's been working until now. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, can you try entering the password again and make sure that it is entered correctly? Sometimes small typos can cause this issue. 

Customer: Alright, I'll give that a try. 

Customer Service Agent: Great! Is that working now? 

Customer: Yes! Thank you so much for your help! 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

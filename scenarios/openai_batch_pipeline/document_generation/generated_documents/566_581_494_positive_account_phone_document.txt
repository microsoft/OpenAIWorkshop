Customer Service Agent: Hi, welcome to Contoso Wireless! How may I help you today? 

Customer: Hi there, I'm looking to purchase a new phone and was wondering if you could help me with that.

Customer Service Agent: Of course! We have a great selection of phones available for purchase. Do you have an account with us? 

Customer: Yes, I do. 

Customer Service Agent: Great! What kind of phone are you looking for? 

Customer: I'm looking for something with a lot of storage, a good camera, and long battery life. 

Customer Service Agent: We have several options that fit your criteria. Would you like me to go over them with you now? 

Customer: That would be great, thank you. 

Customer Service Agent: Sure thing! We currently have the Contoso 10X available for purchase. It has 128GB of storage, a dual-lens 12MP camera, and a battery life of up to 24 hours on a single charge. It also has an expansive 6.5-inch display and is compatible with our latest 5G network. Would this be something you'd be interested in? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds perfect! Can I get some more information about the phone before I purchase it? 

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! The Contoso 10X comes with the latest version of our operating system which includes features like facial recognition, voice control, and advanced AI technology. It also has access to our extensive app store and comes with a one year warranty. Does this sound like something you would be interested in? 

Customer: Yes, this sounds great! Can I get some more information about the cost and payment plans? 

Customer Service Agent: Sure thing! The Contoso 10X retails for $799 but we do offer financing plans that can spread out the cost over several months. We also offer discounts for students and military personnel so if you qualify for either of those programs you may be eligible for additional savings. Does this sound like something you would be interested in? 

Customer: Yes, definitely! This sounds like the perfect phone for me. Can I get started on my purchase today? 

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! Let me just gather some information from you so we can get started on your purchase.

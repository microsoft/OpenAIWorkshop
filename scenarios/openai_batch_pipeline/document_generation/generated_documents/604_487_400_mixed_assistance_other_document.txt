Hello, I'm looking for some assistance with a product I recently purchased from Contoso Wireless.

Agent:
Hello there, my name is [Name] and I'm a customer service representative for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer:
I recently purchased a phone from your company and it's not working properly. I've tried troubleshooting it but nothing seems to be working. Is there anything you can do to help?

Agent:
I'm sorry to hear that you're having issues with your phone. Can you tell me what the issue is? 

Customer:
Well, when I try to make a call or send a text, it keeps giving me an error message. I've tried restarting the phone and checking the settings but nothing seems to be helping. 

Agent:
I understand your frustration. Have you tried resetting your network settings? That may help resolve this issue. 

Customer: 
No, I haven't tried that yet. Is that something I can do on my own? 

Agent: 
Yes, it is something you can do on your own. You can reset your network settings by going into the Settings menu on your phone and then selecting the option to reset your network settings. Once you have done that, please restart your phone and try again. 

Customer: 
Ok, I'll give that a try. Is there anything else I should know about the product before I try this? 

Agent: 
Yes, make sure that you have the most up-to-date version of the software installed on your phone. This will ensure that all features are working properly and will also help prevent any future issues with the product. You can check for updates in the Settings menu of your phone as well. 

Customer: 
Ok, got it. Thanks for all the help!

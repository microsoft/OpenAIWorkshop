Customer: Hi, I'm interested in upgrading my Contoso Wireless internet service. What are my options?

Agent: Hi there! We are glad to hear that you are considering upgrading your Contoso Wireless internet service. We have several different upgrade packages that you can choose from depending on your needs and budget. What kind of speeds are you looking for?

Customer: Well, I'm not sure. I know that I want something faster than what I currently have, but I'm not sure what speeds I need. Can you help me out?

Agent: Sure! We can certainly help you out. Let me give you a rundown of our different packages so you can get an idea of what is available. Our most basic package is 10 Mbps, which is great for streaming video and basic web browsing. Then we have a package that offers 25 Mbps, which is better for downloading large files and gaming. And then we have our 50 Mbps package, which is ideal for multiple users in a household and for those who do a lot of streaming.

Customer: Okay, that's helpful. How much does each package cost?

Agent: Our 10 Mbps package is $29.99 per month, the 25 Mbps package is $49.99 per month, and the 50 Mbps package is $69.99 per month. All packages also include free installation and 24/7 customer support. 

Customer: That sounds great! I think I want to go with the 50 Mbps package. What do I need to do to get started? 

Agent: All you need to do is give us a call at 1-800-Contoso and we will be happy to get you set up with the new service. We will need some information from you such as your address, credit card number, etc., but it should only take a few minutes to get everything set up. 

Customer: Great! Can I ask one more question before I go ahead and make the call? 

Agent: Of course! What would you like to know? 

Customer: Are there any other discounts or deals available if I upgrade my service? 

Agent: Yes, absolutely! We have several different promotions and discounts available for customers who upgrade their service with us. We also offer bundle deals if you're interested in adding additional services such as TV or phone services to your account. Just give us a call at 1-800-Contoso and we will be happy to discuss all the options available to you.

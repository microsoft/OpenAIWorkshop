Hello, I'm having an issue with my phone from Contoso Wireless. It's been really unreliable lately and I'm considering switching carriers. Can you help me?

Agent: 

I completely understand how frustrating this can be. Let me take a look into what we can do to try and resolve the issue for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: 

Yes, actually. Are there any discounts or special offers available for customers considering switching carriers?

 Customer: 
Sure, here it is [inserts account information]. So what kind of offers do you have available?

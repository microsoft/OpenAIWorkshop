Customer: Wow, that's great! What are the prices for these different packages?

Agent: The basic package starts at $29.99 per month, and the advanced packages range from $49.99 to $99.99 per month. The fiber-optic package is our most expensive package and starts at $119.99 per month. 

Customer: Do you offer any discounts for upgrading? 

Agent: Yes, we do offer discounts for upgrading your service. If you choose to upgrade from a basic package to an advanced or fiber-optic package, we will give you a 10% discount off of the price of the new package. 

Customer: That sounds great! Are there any other benefits that come with upgrading? 

Agent: Yes, there are several benefits that come with upgrading your service. With an upgraded package, you will get access to faster speeds and more reliable service, as well as additional features such as increased data caps and parental control options. You will also get priority customer service if you ever need help or have any questions about your service. 

Customer: That's really helpful! Is there anything else I should know before I decide to upgrade? 

Agent: The only other thing to keep in mind is that all upgraded packages come with a two-year contract, so make sure you are comfortable committing to the service for that long before making your decision. 

Customer: Alright, I think I understand everything now. Thanks for all your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can do for you today?

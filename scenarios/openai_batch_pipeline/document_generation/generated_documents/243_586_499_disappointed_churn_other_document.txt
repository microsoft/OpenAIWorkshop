Customer: 
Hello, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm very disappointed with the product. I'm looking to switch to another provider. Can you tell me more about what other providers offer?

Agent:
Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're not satisfied with Contoso Wireless. We value our customers and want to make sure that they are getting the best service possible. Can you tell me a bit more about why you are looking to switch providers? 

Customer: 
Well, the coverage is spotty in my area and I've had multiple issues with customer service. Plus, I feel like I'm paying too much for what I get. What other providers have better coverage and better customer service? 

Agent: 
I understand why you would be looking for a different provider in this case. At Contoso Wireless, we strive to provide excellent customer service and reliable coverage for all of our customers. Unfortunately, I can't speak on behalf of other providers, but I can tell you that we do have plans that may fit your needs better. Would you like me to go over them with you? 

Customer: 
Yes, please. I'd like to see what other options are available before making a decision. 

Agent: 
Of course! We have several different plans available, ranging from basic talk-and-text plans all the way up to unlimited data plans with added features such as hotspot access. Which type of plan are you interested in? 

Customer: 
I'm mostly interested in an unlimited data plan with hotspot access if possible. What do those plans cost? 

Agent: 
Our unlimited data plans with hotspot access start at $50 per month. This plan includes unlimited data, talk and text, plus access to 5G speeds when available and 10GB of hotspot access per month. Does this sound like something that might interest you? 

Customer: 
That does sound interesting. Can you tell me more about the coverage in my area? Is it reliable? 

Agent: 
Yes, absolutely! Our coverage in your area is reliable and we have 5G speeds available in most areas as well. If you're interested in trying out one of our unlimited data plans, we can set it up for you right away and you can start enjoying the benefits of our network immediately!

Customer: "I'm really frustrated. I just signed up for the Contoso Wireless TV service and it's not working properly. Can you help me?"

Agent: "I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll be happy to help you get the service running properly. Could you tell me a bit more about what is happening with your TV service?"

Customer: "Well, it's been downgraded from HD to SD and I can't seem to get it back to HD."

Agent: "I understand your frustration. We can certainly help you with that. Do you have a Contoso Wireless TV box?"

Customer: "Yes, I do."

Agent: "Ok, great. Please try restarting your Contoso Wireless TV box by unplugging it from the power source and plugging it back in after a few minutes. Then check to see if the picture quality is back to HD." 

Customer: "Ok, I'll try that. But why did my service get downgraded in the first place?" 

Agent: "We're sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Unfortunately, sometimes due to high demand, our services may be downgraded temporarily. However, we strive to ensure our customers have the best possible experience with our services." 

Customer: "So why wasn't I notified of this before my service was downgraded? I didn't know anything about it until now." 

Agent: "We apologize for any confusion this may have caused you. We typically send notifications when services are downgraded or changed in any way. If you haven't received any notifications from us recently, please let us know and we can look into it further." 

Customer: "Ok, I'll let you know if I don't receive any notifications. In the meantime, how long will it take for my service to be restored back to HD?" 

Agent: "Once you've restarted your Contoso Wireless TV box as directed, your service should be restored back to HD shortly after that. If there are any further issues with your service, please contact us so we can help you further."

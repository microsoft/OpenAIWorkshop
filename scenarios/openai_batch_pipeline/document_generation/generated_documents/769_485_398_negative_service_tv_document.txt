"I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless tv and I'm not satisfied with the product. It's not working properly, and I'm very disappointed."

Customer Service Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. Can you tell me more about the issue you are having with your Contoso Wireless tv?"

Customer: 
"Well, it's just not working at all. I've been trying to troubleshoot it but nothing seems to work."

Customer Service Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating this must be. Can you please provide me with some more details about the problem you are experiencing? Are there any error messages you're seeing?"

Customer: 
"No, I'm not getting any error messages. It just won't turn on. I've tried pressing the power button multiple times but nothing happens."

Customer Service Agent: 
"Okay, let's try a few other troubleshooting steps to see if we can get the tv to turn on. First, could you please check if the power cord is connected properly? If it is, can you try plugging it into a different outlet?"

Customer: 
"Yes, the power cord is connected properly. I've already tried plugging it into a different outlet but still nothing happens."

Customer Service Agent: 
"All right. Can you please try holding down the power button for five seconds? That may help reset the tv."

Customer: 
"I've already tried that too, but it still won't turn on. This is really frustrating."

Customer Service Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating this must be. As a last resort, I recommend that you unplug the tv and wait for 30 minutes before plugging it back in and trying again. If that doesn't work, we can look into getting you a replacement or refund."

Customer: Okay. 

Agent: Alright, I've found the details of your order. According to our records, the payment for your Contoso Wireless TV has been processed and it should be delivered within the next three to five business days. 

Customer: Okay, great! So if I don't receive it in that time frame, what should I do?

Customer: Alright, thank you for the information. Is there anything else that I need to know before the delivery? 

Agent: Yes, please make sure that someone is available to accept the delivery at the address provided when placing the order. Also, please ensure that there is enough space at the delivery address to accommodate the Contoso Wireless TV as it is quite large and bulky. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the delivery process, please do not hesitate to contact us again. 

Customer: That makes sense, thank you for letting me know. Is there anything else that I need to do before the delivery? 

Agent: No, there is nothing else that needs to be done before the delivery. Just make sure that someone is available to accept it when it arrives and have a great day!

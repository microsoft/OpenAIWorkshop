Customer: Hi, I'm looking to upgrade my Contoso Wireless services. Can you help me out?

Agent: Absolutely! What kind of upgrade are you looking for?

Customer: Well, I'm thinking about getting a new TV. Do you offer any upgrade services related to that?

Agent: Yes, we do offer an upgrade service for TVs. We can provide you with the latest models at a discounted price. What size TV are you interested in? 

Customer: I'm looking for a 55 inch. Do you have any models that offer 4K resolution? 

Agent: Yes, we do have several models that offer 4K resolution. Would you like me to show you the different options we have available? 

Customer: That would be great! 

Agent: Alright. Let me pull up our list of TVs and we can go over them together. (Agent pulls up list of TVs) Here are all the TVs that offer 4K resolution and are 55 inches in size. You can see the prices listed next to each model. (Shows customer the list) 

Customer: Wow, these look great! What's the best deal here? 

Agent: The best deal right now is on this model right here (points to a specific model). It's currently on sale for $500 and comes with a two year warranty. 

Customer: That sounds like a great deal! How soon can I get it set up? 

Agent: We can have it set up within two days. We will send out a technician to install the TV and make sure everything is working properly. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Please let us know if there's anything else we can do for you. Have a great day!

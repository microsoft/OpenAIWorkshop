Customer:

Hello, I'm having some trouble with my Contoso Wireless phone. Can you help me?

Agent:

Hello! Yes, we can certainly help. What seems to be the problem? 

Customer:

Well, it won't turn on. I've tried charging it and nothing happens. 

Agent:

I understand how frustrating this can be. Let's see if we can figure out what is going on. First, could you please tell me what model of Contoso Wireless phone you are using? 

Customer: 
I have the Contoso Wireless XR model. 

Agent: 
Okay, great. Can you tell me if the device has ever turned on before? 

Customer: 
Yes, it has been working fine until a few days ago when it just stopped working. I've tried charging it but nothing happens. 

Agent: 
I see. Have you attempted to reset the device? If not, I recommend that you try that as a possible solution. To do this, press and hold both the power and volume down buttons for 10 seconds until you see the Contoso logo on your screen. 

Customer: 
Ok, I'll give that a try. 

 Agent: 
Great! If that doesn't work, please let me know and we can look into other solutions for you.

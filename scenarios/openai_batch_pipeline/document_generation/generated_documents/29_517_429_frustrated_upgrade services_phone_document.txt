Hello, this is [Name] from Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today? 

Customer: 

I need some help with upgrading my phone. I'm really frustrated. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I apologize for your frustration. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue you're having? 

Customer: 

Yes, I bought a new phone from Contoso Wireless about 6 months ago, and now I'm trying to upgrade it but it's not working. It's really frustrating because I've already paid for the upgrade and I just want it to work. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I understand your frustration. Let me see what I can do to help you out with this issue. Can you please provide me with the model number of the phone that you're trying to upgrade? 

Customer: 

Yes, it's a Contoso Wireless Model XSX-1000. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Ok, let me take a look at that model and see if I can figure out why the upgrade isn't working. In the meantime, can you tell me what kind of upgrade you were trying to do? 

Customer: 
Yes, I was trying to upgrade my data plan to 10GB per month. 

 Customer Service Agent: 
Ok, let me take a look at the phone and see if I can find out why the upgrade isn't working. Can you please give me a few minutes while I investigate this further? 

 Customer: 
Sure, go ahead and take your time.

 Customer Service Agent: 
Thank you for your patience. After taking a look at the phone's system settings, it looks like the issue is related to a compatibility issue between your current data plan and the new plan that you're trying to upgrade to. We should be able to resolve this issue by upgrading your firmware and reinstalling your current data plan on the phone. Do you want me to proceed with this process?

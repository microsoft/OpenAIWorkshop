Customer Service Agent:

Welcome to Contoso Wireless! How can I help you today? 

Customer:

I'm having trouble with my bill. I'm being charged for a TV that I didn't order! 

Customer Service Agent:

I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's take a look and see what we can do to help. Can you provide me with your account information? 

Customer:

Yes, here it is. 

Customer Service Agent: 

Thank you. I'm pulling up your account now. It looks like you were charged for a new TV that was added to your account on October 10th. Is that correct? 

Customer: 

Yes, that's right. But I didn't order a TV! I don't even own one! 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand your frustration. Let me see if I can help you with this issue. Do you have any receipts or proof of purchase that can verify that you did not order the TV? 

Customer: 
No, I don't have any proof of purchase. I thought the charge was from something else so I didn't look into it until now. 

Customer Service Agent: 
That's understandable. Let me take a closer look at this and see what we can do. Can you please hold while I investigate further? 

 Customer: 
Yes, of course. 

 Customer Service Agent: 
Thanks for holding. After looking further into this, it appears that there was an error on our end and the TV was added to your account in error. We will be removing the charge from your account and issuing you a full refund for the cost of the TV. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Is there anything else I can do for you today?

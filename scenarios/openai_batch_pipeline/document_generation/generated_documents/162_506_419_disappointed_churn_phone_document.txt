Customer: I'm really disappointed with the Contoso Wireless phone I purchased. I was expecting a better quality product.

Agent: Hi there, I apologize for any dissatisfaction you have experienced with our product. Can you tell me more about the issue you are having?

Customer: Well, the phone has been constantly freezing and lagging when I use it. I'm afraid it will eventually stop working altogether.

Agent: That doesn't sound good at all. We want to make sure that our customers are satisfied with our products and services. What type of phone did you purchase?

Customer: It's the Contoso Wireless Smartphone.

Agent: Okay, let me look into this for you. Can you please provide me with the model number of your device?

Customer: Sure, it's model CW-3345.

Agent: Thank you for that information. Please give me one moment while I investigate further into your issue.

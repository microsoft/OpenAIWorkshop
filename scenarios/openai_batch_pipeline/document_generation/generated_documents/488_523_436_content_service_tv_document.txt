Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a new Contoso Wireless tv and I'm having some issues with it. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi there! Of course, we would be more than happy to help. Can you tell me a bit more about the issues you're experiencing?

Customer: Sure. The sound is really low and I can't seem to adjust it properly. It's also not connecting to my wifi properly. 

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let's start with the sound issue first. Can you try pressing the volume up button on your remote and see if that helps?

Customer: Yes, I tried that but it didn't make any difference.

Agent: Alright. In that case, let's try a different approach. Have you tried resetting the tv? This should help reset the audio settings back to default and hopefully improve the sound quality. 

Customer: Yes, I tried that but it still isn't working properly. 

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me take a look at your account and see if I can find out what might be causing this issue. Could you please provide me with your account information so that I can access it? 

Customer: Sure, here you go (provides account information). 

Agent: Perfect, thank you! I'll take a look at your account and see what's going on with your tv. In the meantime, let's move on to your wifi connection issue. What kind of connection do you have? Is it a wired or wireless connection? 

Customer: It's a wireless connection using my home router. 

Agent: Okay, great! In that case, please try restarting both your router and tv and then check if the wifi connection is working properly again. 

Customer: Alright, I'll try that now and let you know how it goes. 

Agent: Sounds good! Please let me know if you have any further questions or need any assistance while troubleshooting this issue. 

 Customer: Will do! Thanks for your help.

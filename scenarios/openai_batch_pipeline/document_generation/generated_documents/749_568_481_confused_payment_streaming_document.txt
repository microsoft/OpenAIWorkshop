Customer Service Agent:

Hello, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer:
Yes, I need some help understanding the payment process for your product streaming service. 

Customer Service Agent:
No problem at all! We’re here to help. Could you tell me a bit more about what you’d like to know?

Customer:
Well, I was looking through the website and it seems like there are several different plans available. Can you explain what each plan includes and how much they cost?

Customer Service Agent: 
Absolutely! Our product streaming service comes in three different plans – Basic, Plus, and Premium. The Basic plan is $9.99 per month and includes access to all of our library of movies and TV shows. The Plus plan is $14.99 per month and includes access to all of our library of movies and TV shows as well as early access to new releases. Finally, the Premium plan is $19.99 per month and includes all of the same features as the Plus plan plus access to exclusive content not available on any other plans. Does that answer your question? 

Customer: 
Yes, that does answer my question, but I'm still a bit confused about how payments work with each plan. Can you explain that to me? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Sure! When you sign up for one of our plans, you will be charged the monthly rate for that plan on a recurring basis until you cancel your subscription or switch to another plan. So if you sign up for the Basic plan, you will be charged $9.99 each month until you cancel or switch plans. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: 
I think that answers my questions about payments, but I still have one more question about streaming quality. Does the quality of the streaming depend on which plan I choose? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, it does! All of our plans offer HD streaming quality but our Premium plan offers Ultra HD streaming quality which is even better than HD. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: 
No, I think that's all I need right now - thank you so much for your help!

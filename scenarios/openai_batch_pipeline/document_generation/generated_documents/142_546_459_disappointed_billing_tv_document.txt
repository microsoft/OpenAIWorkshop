Customer: Hi, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm having an issue with my billing. 

Agent: Hi there, my name is [Agent Name], and I'm the customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you with your billing issue? 

Customer: Well, I recently purchased a new TV from Contoso and was charged for it on my bill. However, the TV hasn't arrived yet and I'm wondering why I was charged if it hasn't arrived. 

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Let me take a look into your account and see what's going on with the order. Can you please provide me with your account information? 

Customer: Sure. My account number is [Account Number]. 

Agent: Thank you. Please give me a moment while I look into this for you.

Agent: Okay, so it looks like the order was placed two weeks ago, and the charge should have been applied to your account when it was placed. It appears that there was an issue with the shipment of the TV, and we haven't been able to send it out yet. We apologize for the delay and will be sure to send out your order as soon as possible. 

Customer: That's not good enough. I've already been charged for something that hasn't even been shipped yet! I want a refund of the charge on my bill. 

Agent: I understand your frustration, but unfortunately we can't provide refunds in these cases. However, as an apology for the delay in shipping, we can offer you a free month of our premium services package. 

Customer: That's not good enough either! You should be able to provide me with a refund if you can't deliver on what you promised. 

Agent: We understand that this isn't ideal, but unfortunately refunds aren't available in these cases due to our policies. We apologize again for the delay in shipping your product and we are doing our best to get it sent out as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can do for you today?

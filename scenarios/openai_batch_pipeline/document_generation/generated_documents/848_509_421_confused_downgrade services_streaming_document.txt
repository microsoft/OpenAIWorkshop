Customer Service Agent: Welcome to Contoso Wireless. How may I help you today?

Customer: Hi, I recently downgraded my services and now I'm having some trouble with streaming. Is there anything you can do to help me out?

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! What kind of streaming are you trying to do?

Customer: I'm trying to stream videos on my phone.

Customer Service Agent: Okay, let's see what we can do. First, let's check your connection speed. Can you please provide me with the speed that you're currently receiving?

Customer: Sure, it's 8 megabits per second.

Customer Service Agent: Alright, that should be enough for streaming. Let's take a look at your phone settings. Can you please tell me what type of phone you have? 

Customer: I have an iPhone 8. 

Customer Service Agent: Great. Now let's make sure that your phone settings are optimized for streaming. Can you please go into your settings and make sure that your data usage is set to "unlimited" and that your Wi-Fi is enabled? 

Customer: Okay, it looks like my data usage is set to "unlimited" and my Wi-Fi is enabled. 

Customer Service Agent: Perfect! Now let's check your streaming app settings. Can you please open the app and go into the settings menu? 

Customer: Sure, I'm in the settings menu now. 

Customer Service Agent: Great! Now let's make sure that the streaming quality is set to "high" and that the data usage is set to "unlimited". 

Customer: Okay, the streaming quality is set to "high" and the data usage is set to "unlimited". 

Customer Service Agent: Wonderful! That should do it. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, I think that should do it. Thanks for all your help!

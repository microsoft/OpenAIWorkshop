Customer: Hi, I’m a customer of Contoso Wireless and I’m confused about the product I just bought. I purchased the TV and I’m not sure if it’s what I expected.

Agent: Hi there! Thanks for contacting us. We are sorry to hear you are confused about your purchase. Could you please tell us more about your issue?

Customer: Sure, when I bought the TV, it said that it had access to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, but when I set it up there were no apps installed. Is this normal?

Agent: Yes, that is normal. The TV does not come with any streaming services pre-installed. You will need to download the apps you want to use from the app store in order to access them.

Customer: Oh okay, that makes sense. But why didn’t Contoso tell me this before I bought it? I don’t want to have to go through all the trouble of downloading each app.

Agent: We apologize for any confusion. To help ensure our customers are informed about all our products, we provide detailed product descriptions on our website and in our catalogues which should have been available to you before purchasing the TV. We also recommend customers contact us with any questions or concerns they may have before making a purchase so we can answer any questions and help make sure they get exactly what they need. 

Customer: Alright, that makes sense. But now I’m worried that I may want to return the TV if it doesn’t work out for me. What is your return policy? 

Agent: Our return policy is 30 days from purchase date with proof of purchase. You may return the TV within this period if you are not completely satisfied with your purchase and we will issue you a full refund. 

Customer: Okay great, thanks for clarifying that. Now one last question - do you offer any discounts or loyalty programs for frequent customers? 

Agent: Yes we do! We have a loyalty program which gives customers discounts on future purchases and access to exclusive offers and promotions. If you sign up for the program, you will be eligible for discounts on future purchases as well as other benefits such as free shipping and early access to new products. 

Customer: That sounds great! Can I sign up now or do I need to wait until after my current purchase is complete? 

Agent: You can sign up now! Just visit our website or contact us directly and we can help you get set up with an account so you can start taking advantage of our loyalty program right away!

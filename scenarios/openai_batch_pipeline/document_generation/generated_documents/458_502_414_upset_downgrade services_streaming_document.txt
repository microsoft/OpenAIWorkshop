Customer: Hello, I'm calling because I'm extremely unhappy with the downgrade of services for Contoso Wireless. I recently signed up for the streaming service, but it's been nothing but problems. 

Agent: Hi there, I apologize for any issues you've experienced with our streaming service. Can you tell me what's been going on? 

Customer: Well, the sound keeps cutting in and out and the picture quality is terrible. It's like watching a bad YouTube video. I'm really frustrated and would like to get my money back. 

Agent: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Our streaming service is usually of much higher quality than what you're experiencing. Can you tell me a bit more about the device you're using to stream? 

Customer: Sure, it's a Samsung Galaxy S9. I've had no issues with any other streaming services or apps on this device, so it must be something with Contoso Wireless. 

Agent: Got it. I'd like to take a look at your account and see if there are any settings that may be causing these issues. May I have your account number? 

Customer: Yes, it's [account number]. 

Agent: Thank you for that information. Let me take a look at your account now... Okay, it looks like everything is set up correctly on your end, which means there may be an issue on our end that we need to address. We'll make sure to investigate this issue further and get back to you as soon as possible with an update. In the meantime, would you like us to credit your account for the streaming service? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great. Thanks for looking into this for me. 

Agent: Of course! We'll go ahead and credit your account now. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should be all for now. Thank you very much!

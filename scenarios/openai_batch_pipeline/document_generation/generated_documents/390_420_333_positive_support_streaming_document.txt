Hello, this is [Name], a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today? 

Customer:

Hi [Name], I'm having an issue with streaming from my Contoso Wireless product. Could you help me with this? 

Customer Service Agent:

Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can you tell me more about what is happening? 

Customer:

Well, when I try to stream something it doesn't seem to be working. The video keeps freezing and the sound is choppy. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this can be. Have you tried resetting your device and trying again? 

Customer: 
Yes, I have tried resetting it but it didn't seem to make any difference. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Okay, let's try one more thing then. Could you try unplugging your device and plugging it back in again? This should reset any temporary glitches that may be causing the issue. 

Customer: 
I just did that and it seems to be working now! Thank you so much for your help! 

Customer Service Agent: 
You're welcome! I'm glad we were able to get it working for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: 
No, that should do it for now. Thank you again for your help! 

 Customer Service Agent: 
You're welcome! Have a great day!

Customer: Hi, I'm looking for assistance with my Contoso Wireless phone.

Agent: Hi there! How can I help you?

Customer: Well, I'm having some trouble with the reception on my phone. It's been cutting out and I can't seem to get a good signal.

Agent: That sounds like a frustrating experience. What kind of Contoso Wireless phone do you have?

Customer: I have the Galaxy S9.

Agent: Alright, let's see what we can do to help you out. Could you tell me more about the reception issue? Are you in an area with good coverage or is it a spotty connection?

Customer: It's spotty, sometimes it works fine but then other times it will just cut out completely. It's really unpredictable.

Agent: Ok, that could be a few things causing this issue. Let's try to troubleshoot and see if we can find the source of the problem. First, have you tried restarting your phone? 

Customer: Yes, I've tried restarting it several times but that hasn't helped. 

Agent: Okay, let's try something else then. Have you updated your phone recently? That might help improve your reception if there are any new updates available. 

Customer: Yes, I've updated it to the latest version but that didn't seem to help either. 

Agent: Alright, we'll try one more thing before we move on to more advanced troubleshooting methods. Have you tried changing your network settings? It could be something related to your network connection that's causing the issue. 

Customer: No, I haven't tried that yet. How do I do that? 

Agent: Sure thing! You can access your network settings by going into your phone's settings and tapping on "Network & Internet." Once there, tap on "Mobile Network" and then select "Preferred Network Type." From here, you'll be able to select which type of network connection you'd like to use for your phone.  Try switching between different types and see if that helps improve your reception. 

Customer: Okay, I'll give it a try! Thanks for the help! 

Agent: You're welcome! If this doesn't work, let me know and we'll look into further troubleshooting steps.

Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble understanding my billing statement from Contoso Wireless. I'm not sure what all the charges are for.

Agent: Hello there! We're glad you reached out to us with your questions. We want to make sure that all of our customers understand their bills, so we are here to help. Can you tell me a bit more about what you need help with?

Customer: Yes, I'm trying to figure out the charges for internet service. It says I'm being charged for it but I'm not sure how much or why. 

Agent: Absolutely, I can help you with that. Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on with your internet service charges. Could you provide me with your account number so that I can pull up your information? 

Customer: Sure, my account number is 123456789. 

Agent: Thanks for providing that information. Let me take a look and see what's going on here. It looks like you have a plan for 10GB of data per month and the charge for that is $50/month. Is that something that you're familiar with? 

Customer: Yes, I remember signing up for that plan but I thought it was only going to be $40/month? 

Agent: That's correct, the price was recently increased to $50/month due to market conditions and demand for our services. We try to keep our prices competitive while still providing quality service and customer support. 

Customer: Alright, that makes sense. Is there anything else I should know about the charges on my bill? 

Agent: Yes, if you go over your data limit in any given month then you will be charged an additional $10/GB of data used over the limit of 10GB/month. 

Customer: Got it, thanks for explaining everything so clearly! Is there anything else I should know before we wrap up this conversation? 

Agent: No problem! The only other thing I wanted to mention is that if you ever need any assistance understanding any other part of your bill then please don't hesitate to reach out to us again and we'll be more than happy to help. 

Customer: Great! Thanks so much for all your help today! 

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day!

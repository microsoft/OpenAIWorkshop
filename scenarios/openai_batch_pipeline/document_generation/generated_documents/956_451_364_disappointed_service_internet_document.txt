Customer: 
Hello, I recently purchased internet service from Contoso Wireless and I'm having some issues with it. I'm not getting the speeds I was promised and I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. 

Agent: 
Hello, I apologize for any issues you may be having with your service. Can you tell me more about the problems you are experiencing? 

Customer: 
Yes, when I first signed up for the service, I was promised speeds of up to 25Mbps but so far my speeds have been much slower. I've been getting around 10 Mbps which is not what was promised. 

Agent: 
I understand your frustration and I apologize for the discrepancy. Can you tell me what kind of device you're using to connect to our service? 

Customer: 
I'm using a laptop with a wireless router. It's a pretty new model so there shouldn't be any issues with the hardware. 

Agent: 
Okay, that's good to know. We'll need to run some tests to make sure that everything is working properly. Can you tell me what type of connection you're using? Is it wired or wireless? 

Customer: 
It's wireless. 

Agent: 
Okay, that's helpful information. We'll need to run some tests to make sure everything is working properly on our end. Can you please stay on the line while we run those tests? 

Customer: 
Yes, I can do that. How long will the tests take? 

Agent: 
The tests should only take a few minutes. Once they are finished we'll have a better idea of what might be causing the issue with your internet speeds.

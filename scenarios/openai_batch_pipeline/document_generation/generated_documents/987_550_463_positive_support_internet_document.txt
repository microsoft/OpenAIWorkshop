Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble with my internet. Can you help?

Agent: Hi there! Of course, I'd be happy to help. What kind of trouble are you experiencing with your internet?

Customer: My connection is really slow and it keeps dropping out.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me take a look at what might be causing the issue. Could you please provide me with some more information about your setup? 

Customer: Sure. I have Contoso Wireless internet with a modem and router. 

Agent: Great, thank you for that information. Can you tell me if the lights on the modem and router are on? 

Customer: Yes, the lights are all on. 

Agent: Alright, that's good news. It looks like there might be an issue with the settings of your router or modem. Can you please tell me if you have made any recent changes to either device? 

Customer: No, I haven't made any changes recently. 

Agent: Okay, then let me take a look at the settings for both devices to see if there is something that needs to be adjusted or updated. Can you please confirm which version of Contoso Wireless internet you are using? 

Customer: I'm using version 5.2. 

Agent: Perfect, thank you for that information. Now, let me check the settings on your router and modem to see if anything needs to be adjusted or updated in order to improve your connection speed and stability. Please bear with me while I do this. 

Customer: No problem! Thanks for helping me out. 

Agent: You're welcome! I've finished checking the settings and it looks like everything is set up correctly and should be working properly now. Could you please try connecting to the internet again and let me know if the connection is still slow or if it's dropping out? 

Customer: Alright, I'll try it now and let you know how it goes. Thanks again for all your help! 

Agent: You're very welcome! Please don't hesitate to contact us again if you need any further assistance with your Contoso Wireless internet connection.

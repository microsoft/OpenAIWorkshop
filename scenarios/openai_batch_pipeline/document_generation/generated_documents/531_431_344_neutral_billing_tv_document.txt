 Okay, it looks like you are currently subscribed to our basic cell phone plan and you recently purchased our Contoso TV package. Is this correct? 

 Customer: 
 Yes, that's right. 

 Agent: 
 Great! It looks like we have some promotional discounts available on both of these services which could help reduce your bill. Would you like to hear more about them? 

 Customer: 
 Yes, please let me know what discounts are available!

Hello, I am having an issue with my Contoso Wireless internet. It has been lagging a lot lately and I'm considering cancelling my subscription. What can you do to help me? 

Agent:

Hello, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with our internet service. Can you tell us more about the issue so we can try to resolve it? 

Customer:

Yes, the internet connection is very slow and it keeps dropping out. I've been having to reset my router multiple times a day. It's very frustrating and it's making it hard for me to work from home. 

Agent:

We apologize for the trouble you're having with our internet service. It sounds like a technical issue that we may be able to help with. Can you provide us with your account information so we can take a look? 

Customer:

Yes, my account number is XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.

We will get back to you as soon as possible with our findings. In the meantime, please let us know if there is anything else we can do to help you. 

 Customer: 

I appreciate that. Is there any way that you can give me some kind of discount on my bill or something? I'm really not happy with the service I'm getting right now and I'm considering switching providers if this issue isn't resolved soon.

 Customer: 

That would be great, thank you! Is there anything else I should do in the meantime while you're looking into my account?

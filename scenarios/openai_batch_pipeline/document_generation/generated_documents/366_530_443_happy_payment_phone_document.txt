Agent: Hi there, great to hear you're interested in purchasing a new phone from Contoso Wireless. We have a few different payment options that you can choose from. Would you like me to explain them to you?

Customer: Sure, that would be great!

Agent: Alright. We accept all major credit cards, as well as PayPal, Venmo, and Apple Pay. We also offer a financing option through our partner Affirm which allows customers to spread out the cost of their purchase over multiple months with 0% APR.

Customer: 
"I've been having trouble with my billing for Contoso Wireless. I signed up for the streaming product, but my bill has been way too high for the past few months. What's going on?"

Agent:
"Hello there, I apologize for the confusion with your bill. Can you tell me more about the streaming product you signed up for? That way I can better understand what may be causing your bill to be higher than usual."

Customer:
"I'm not sure what's going on either. I signed up for the streaming product which included two devices. The monthly subscription cost was supposed to be around $50, but my bill is much higher than that."

Agent:
"I understand your concern. Let me look into this for you and see if I can find out why your bill is higher than expected. Can you provide me with some additional information about your account such as the date of sign up and any other services you have purchased from us?"

Customer: 
"Sure, I signed up for the streaming product on June 1st and I haven't purchased any additional services since then. I'm really confused as to why my bill is so high."

Agent: 
"Alright, let me take a look at your account and see if I can figure out what's causing the issue with your bill. In the meantime, could you tell me a bit more about the streaming product? Is it a streaming video service or something else?" 

Customer: 
"It's a streaming video service, but it also includes access to music and other content. It should only cost $50 per month, so I don't understand why my bill is so high." 

Agent: 
"I understand your confusion and I'm doing my best to figure out why your bill is higher than expected. Could you please provide me with some additional information about the streaming service such as what type of device it's being used on or if any additional features have been added since signing up?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, the streaming service is being used on two devices - an iPad and an iPhone. As far as additional features, nothing has been added since signing up." 

Agent: 
"Thank you for that information. Let me take a look at your account and see if I can find out why your bill is higher than expected. I'll get back to you as soon as possible with an update."

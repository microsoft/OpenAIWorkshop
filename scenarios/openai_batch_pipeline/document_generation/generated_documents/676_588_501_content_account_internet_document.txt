Customer: Hi, I'm having an issue with my Contoso Wireless internet.

Agent: Hi there, how can I help you with your Contoso Wireless internet?

Customer: Well, I'm not sure what's wrong. It was working fine earlier today, but now it's not connecting.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Are you able to access your account online or through the app?

Customer: Yes, I can access my account.

Agent: That's great! Can you tell me what device you are trying to connect to the internet?

Customer: It's a laptop.

Agent: Alright, let's see if we can get your laptop connected to the internet. First, let's check your account settings and make sure they are correct. Can you log in to your Contoso Wireless account and navigate to the Account Settings page? 

Customer: Yes, I can do that. 

Agent: Great! Please take a look at the settings on that page and make sure everything looks correct. If it does, then let's move on to the next step. 

Customer: Ok, everything looks good on the Account Settings page. What should I do next? 

Agent: The next step is to check your connection settings on your laptop. We'll need to make sure that it is connecting to the correct network and that it has all of the correct login information. Can you open up the connection settings and tell me what network it is trying to connect to? 

Customer: Yes, it is trying to connect to the Contoso Wireless network. 

Agent: Perfect! Now we just need to make sure that all of the login information is correct. Can you double-check that it has your username and password for Contoso Wireless entered correctly? 

Customer: Yes, everything looks good there too. 

Agent: Alright, it looks like everything is set up correctly on both your account and your laptop. Let's try one more thing before we move on - could you try restarting both your laptop and modem/router? This will help reset any temporary issues with the connection and should get you back online quickly. 

Customer: Sure, I can do that now. 

Agent: Great! After you restart them both, please try connecting again and let me know if you're still having any issues.

"I am so angry! I recently downgraded my services with Contoso Wireless, and now my internet is not working properly. What is going on?"

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you tell me a bit more about what you're experiencing?"

Customer: 
"Well, my internet is incredibly slow and it keeps dropping out. It's been like this for days!"

Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating this must be. Can you tell me if this is happening on all of your devices?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, it's happening on my laptop, phone, and tablet. I'm really not happy about this." 

Agent: 
"I apologize for the trouble you are experiencing. Can you tell me when you downgraded your services?" 

Customer: 
"I downgraded my services about a week ago, and the internet problems started a few days after that." 

Agent: 
"I see. Let me check your account to see if there's any information that could help us troubleshoot this issue." 

Customer: 
"Okay, please hurry! I need the internet to work as soon as possible." 

Agent: 
"Of course. Please give me one moment while I check your account." (2 minutes pass) "It looks like there was an issue with the downgrade that caused some technical difficulties with your internet connection. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. We can resolve this quickly by upgrading your service back to its original level." 

Customer: 
"Will that solve the issue? I don't want to have to go through this again!" 

Agent: 
"Yes, it should fix the problem. We'll waive any upgrade fees so that you don't have to worry about any extra charges." 

Customer: 
"That sounds good. Please go ahead and do that then."

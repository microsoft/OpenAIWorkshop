Customer:
Hello, I recently bought Contoso Wireless internet service and I'm having trouble connecting to the internet. Can you help me?

Agent:
Hello, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Can you tell me more about the issue you are having?

Customer:
Sure, I've been trying to connect to the internet but I keep getting a message that says "No Internet Access". Is there something wrong with my router? 

Agent:
Let's see if we can figure out what is causing the issue. First, can you confirm that your router is plugged in and turned on?

Customer:
Yes, it is plugged in and turned on. 

Agent: 
Great. Now, can you please tell me what kind of internet connection you are using? Is it wired or wireless? 

Customer: 
It's wireless. 

Agent: 
Ok, great. Can you please try resetting your router by unplugging it from the wall outlet for 10 seconds and then plugging it back in? This will help reset the connection and should fix the issue. 

Customer: 
Alright, I'll try that. Is there anything else I should do? 

Agent: 
Yes, after resetting your router, please wait for a few minutes for it to reconnect to the network and then try connecting to the internet again. If that doesn't work, please contact us again and we will be happy to assist you further. 

Customer: 
Alright, thank you for your help! I'll try that and let you know how it goes. 

 Agent: 
You're welcome! Please feel free to contact us again if you need any further assistance with your Contoso Wireless service. Have a nice day!

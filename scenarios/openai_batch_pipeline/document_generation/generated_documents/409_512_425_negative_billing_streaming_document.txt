Customer: 
"I just received my bill for my Contoso Wireless service and I'm not happy. I was charged for a streaming product that I didn't order. I don't even know what this streaming product is!"

Customer Service Agent:
"I apologize for the confusion. Let me explain what the streaming product is and how it is billed. The streaming product is a service that allows you to access video, music, and other content on your phone. The charge appears on your bill because you have subscribed to the service."

Customer: 
"That's not what I wanted. How do I cancel it?"

Customer Service Agent: 
"I understand. Canceling the streaming product is simple. All you have to do is log into your account and go to the subscription page. From there, you can manage your subscriptions and cancel the streaming product."

Customer: 
"That's not good enough. I want to be refunded for this charge."

Customer Service Agent: 
"I apologize, but we are unable to refund charges for services that have already been used. However, if you cancel the streaming product within 14 days of subscribing, we can provide you with a full refund."

Customer: 
"That's not acceptable. This isn't my fault and I shouldn't have to pay for something I didn't order."

Customer Service Agent: 
"I understand your frustration, but unfortunately we cannot issue a refund if you do not cancel within 14 days of subscribing. However, if you cancel the streaming product now, we can provide you with a full refund."

Customer: 
"Fine, I'll cancel it now. But this isn't fair - I shouldn't have to pay for something I didn't even order!"

Customer Service Agent: 
"I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. We value all of our customers and want to make sure everyone is satisfied with their experience with Contoso Wireless. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

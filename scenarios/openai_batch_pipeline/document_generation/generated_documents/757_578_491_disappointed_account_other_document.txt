Customer:

Hello, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm very disappointed with the service I've been receiving. My account has been having issues and I wanted to find out more about the product I purchased. Can you help me?

Agent:

Good afternoon! I apologize for any issues you have experienced with your account. We value our customers and want to make sure you have the best experience possible. Could you tell me more about what product you purchased? 

Customer:

Yes, I purchased a new phone from Contoso Wireless and my account has been having problems ever since. I just want to make sure that I'm getting the best product possible for my money. 

Agent:

I understand, and we want to make sure that all our customers are getting the most out of their purchases. Could you tell me what issues you have been experiencing with your account? 

Customer: 
Well, for starters, my account was charged twice for the same purchase. And then when I tried to get a refund for the extra charge, I was told that it wasn't possible. It's very frustrating and makes me question why I even bother shopping with Contoso Wireless in the first place. 

Agent: 
I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. We take our customer's satisfaction seriously and we want to make sure that we resolve any issue as soon as possible. Can you tell me which product you purchased so we can look into this further? 

Customer: 
Yes, I purchased an iPhone 11 Pro Max with 256GB storage. 

Agent: 
Alright, let me take a look at your account and see what might be causing this issue. Could you please provide me with your account information so that I can do so? 

Customer: 
Yes, here is my account number [redacted]. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing your account information. Let me take a look at this and see what might be causing this issue. In the meantime, would you like to know more about our other products and services? We have some great deals on our newest phones and plans that could benefit you greatly. 

Customer: 
Yes, that would be great. Please let me know what other products or services Contoso Wireless offers that could help me out.

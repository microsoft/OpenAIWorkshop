Customer: Hello, I'm calling about my Contoso Wireless internet service. 

Agent: Hi there, how can I help you?

Customer: Well, I'm having some issues with my internet connection. It's been slow and unreliable lately.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take a look at your account and see what might be causing the issue. Could you provide me with your account information?

Customer: Sure, my account number is 123456. 

Agent: Thank you. Just give me a few moments to take a look at your account. 

[Pause] 

Agent: Okay, it looks like your service plan does not include unlimited data. You have a limited amount of data that you can use each month, and when you exceed that limit, the speed of your connection can be reduced. 

Customer: Oh, okay. Is there any way to increase my data limit? 

Agent: Yes, we do offer plans with more data than the one you currently have. I can help you switch to one of these plans if you'd like. 

Customer: That would be great! Can you tell me more about the different plans and their pricing? 

Agent: Absolutely! We offer several different plans that come with various amounts of data. The prices range from $49 per month for 10GB of data all the way up to $99 per month for unlimited data. Which plan would you like to switch to? 

Customer: Hmm...I think I'll go with the 20GB plan for $69 per month. That should be enough for my needs. 

Agent: Great choice! Let me just make a few adjustments to your account and then we'll be all set. Give me one moment while I make the changes. 

[Pause] 

Agent: Alright, it looks like everything is set up and ready to go! Your new plan will take effect immediately, and you should start seeing an improvement in your internet connection right away. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should do it for now. Thank you for your help!

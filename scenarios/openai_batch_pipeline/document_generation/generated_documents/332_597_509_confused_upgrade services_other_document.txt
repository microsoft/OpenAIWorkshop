Customer: Hi, I'm trying to upgrade my wireless services but I'm confused about the different products. Can you explain them to me?

Agent: Hi there! Sure, I'd be happy to help. Contoso Wireless offers a variety of products and services to help you stay connected. We have a range of plans that offer unlimited data, talk, and text. We also have a selection of phones, tablets, and other devices that you can choose from. Which product are you interested in learning more about? 

Customer: Well, I'm mainly interested in learning more about the unlimited data plans. What are the different options?

Agent: Absolutely! We offer three different unlimited data plans. The first is our basic plan which includes unlimited talk and text with 3GB of high speed data for $39.99 per month. The second plan includes 10GB of high speed data for $59.99 per month. The third plan includes unlimited talk and text with 20GB of high speed data for $79.99 per month. 

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference between the plans?

Agent: The main difference between the plans is the amount of high speed data that comes with each plan. The basic plan includes 3GB of high speed data while the second plan includes 10GB and the third plan includes 20GB of high speed data. 

Customer: Alright, so what happens if I exceed my data limit?

Agent: Yes! All of our plans include access to our nationwide network, free international calling to select countries, and access to our customer support team 24/7. 

Customer: That sounds great! Is there anything else I should know before signing up for a plan? 

Agent: Yes! Before signing up for a plan, you should make sure that you have compatible devices with our network as well as check to make sure that your area is covered by our service. You can do this by using our coverage map on our website or by calling our customer support team.

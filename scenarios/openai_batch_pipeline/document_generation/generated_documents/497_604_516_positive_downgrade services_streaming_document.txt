Customer: Hi there! I'm looking to downgrade my streaming service with Contoso Wireless. Can you tell me what my options are?

Agent: Hi there! Thanks for reaching out to us. We understand that sometimes it makes more sense to switch to a different plan that better fits your needs. Let me walk you through the different plans we offer for streaming services. 

Customer: That sounds great! What are my options?

Agent: We offer two different plans for streaming services. The first plan is our basic plan, which includes access to up to 10 channels with limited data usage. The second plan is our premium plan, which includes access to over 30 channels with unlimited data usage. Which one of these plans would you like to learn more about? 

Customer: The premium plan sounds like it would be best for me. Can you tell me more about it? 

Agent: Absolutely! Our premium plan includes access to over 30 channels, as well as unlimited data usage. You'll also get access to exclusive content and special offers. The monthly cost for this plan is $19.99 per month. Is this something that interests you? 

Customer: Yes, this sounds perfect! Can I add additional channels or packages to this plan? 

Agent: Absolutely! We have a variety of additional channels and packages that you can add on to your existing premium plan. For example, we have a sports package that includes access to all major sports networks, as well as a movie package that includes access to all major movie networks. Would you like me to go over these packages with you? 

Customer: Yes please! That would be great. 

Agent: Sure thing! Our sports package includes access to all major sports networks and will cost an additional $5 per month. Our movie package includes access to all major movie networks and will cost an additional $7 per month. Do any of these packages interest you? 

Customer: Yes, the sports package sounds perfect! How do I go about adding it to my existing plan? 

Agent: No problem! All you need to do is give us a call at 1-800-Contoso and we'll be happy to add the package for you right away. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all for now! Thanks for your help. 

Agent: You're welcome! We're glad we could help. Have a great day!

Customer: "I just received the phone yesterday and I've been trying to make a payment but it's not going through. What's the problem?"

Agent: "I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me which payment method you are using? Is it a credit card, debit card, or something else?"

Customer: "It's a credit card. Why isn't it working? Is there something wrong with your system?"

Agent: "We don't believe there is an issue with our system, but we can certainly look into it further. Could you please provide me with your order number so that I can check on your payment status?"

Hello, and welcome to Contoso Wireless! How can I help you today?

Customer:

Hi, I'm having an issue with my phone. I'm not happy with the service I'm getting and I'd like to downgrade my plan. 

Customer Service Agent:

I apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced. Can you tell me more about what kind of phone you're using? 

Customer: 

Yes, it's a Contoso Wireless phone. I've been on the same plan for a while now and it's just not cutting it anymore. I'd like to downgrade my plan. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I understand. We do have several options for downgrading your plan that may better suit your needs. Would you like to hear more about them? 

Customer: 
Yes, please. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Excellent! We offer several plans that allow you to reduce your monthly cost while still keeping the same features and benefits as your current plan. For example, our Basic Plan offers unlimited talk and text, as well as 500 MB of data per month for $35 a month. Would this be something you would be interested in? 

 Customer: 
Yes, that sounds like it could work for me. Is there any way to get more data? 

 Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, absolutely! We offer an Enhanced Plan which includes unlimited talk and text plus 2 GB of data per month for $45 a month. Would this be something you would be interested in? 

 Customer: 
Yes, that sounds perfect. Is there any way to get an even better deal?

 Customer Service Agent: 
Absolutely! We have a Premium Plan which includes unlimited talk and text plus 5 GB of data per month for $55 a month. This is our best value plan and will give you the most bang for your buck! Would this be something you would be interested in?

Customer: Hi, I'm looking to downgrade my Contoso Wireless services. Can you tell me more about what that would entail?

Agent: Hi there, absolutely! Downgrading your services with Contoso Wireless is a simple process. We offer different plans and packages to meet different needs. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for?

Customer: Well, I'm looking for something that will provide the same amount of coverage but with fewer features. Do you have any options like that?

Agent: Yes, we do have some options that can provide the same coverage with fewer features. We have several plans available that may suit your needs. For example, our basic plan offers coverage for up to four devices and includes unlimited talk and text, but does not include data. Our mid-level plan offers coverage for up to eight devices and includes unlimited talk and text plus 5GB of data. Our premium plan offers coverage for up to twelve devices and includes unlimited talk and text plus 10GB of data. Which one of these plans would you be interested in?

Customer: That's great, thank you. I think I'd like to go with the basic plan since I don't need a lot of data. Can you tell me a bit more about this plan?

Agent: Sure! Our basic plan provides coverage for up to four devices and includes unlimited talk and text, but does not include data. It also includes access to our customer service team in case you ever need help or have any questions. This plan is perfect for those who don't need a lot of data or want to keep their costs down. Is this something you're interested in?

Customer: Yes, that sounds great! How much does it cost per month?

Agent: The basic plan is $39.99 per month plus taxes and fees. This price does not include any additional charges for overages or roaming fees if applicable. Is this something you'd like to proceed with?

Customer: Yes, I think so. What's the process for downgrading my services?

Agent: Great! To downgrade your services all you need to do is contact us at our customer service number or visit our website to initiate the downgrade process. Once we receive your request we'll send out an email confirming the downgrade and then your services will be changed within 48 hours. Does this sound okay?

Customer: Yes, that sounds good. Is there anything else I should know before downgrading my services? 

Agent: Not necessarily, but it's always a good idea to double-check any changes to make sure they fit your needs before making them permanent. Also, if you decide at any time that you'd like to upgrade your services back to their original levels then just let us know and we'll be happy to help make that happen too!

Customer:

Hello, I recently downgraded my internet service with Contoso Wireless and I'm not happy with the product. Can you explain what I'm getting for my money?

Agent:

Hello, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. We understand that you are not satisfied with your current internet service. We are sorry to hear this. Please allow me to explain what you get when you downgrade your internet service. 

Customer:

Ok, please explain. I want to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. 

Agent:

Of course! Our basic internet plan offers speeds up to 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload, with a monthly data cap of 300 GB. You will also have access to our secure Wi-Fi network, which includes parental controls and malware protection. 

Customer:

That doesn't sound like a lot of speed or data for the price I'm paying. Is there anything else included in the plan? 

Agent: 
Yes, we also include free installation and free 24/7 customer support. You also have the option to add additional features such as home security and automated backup services for an additional fee. 

Customer: 
What if I need more speed or data? Is there any way to upgrade my plan without breaking the bank? 

Agent: 
Yes, we offer several different plans that can be customized to fit your needs. If you need more speed or data, we can upgrade your plan to provide faster speeds up to 100 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload, as well as larger data caps up to 1 TB per month. 

Customer: 
That sounds better, but what about the cost? 

Agent: 
The cost of upgrading your plan depends on several factors such as the speed and data cap you select. The cost will also depend on where you live and any promotional offers we may have available at the time of upgrade. However, rest assured that we always strive to provide our customers with competitive rates and quality service. 

Customer: 
That's good to know. So how do I go about upgrading my plan? 

Agent: 
To upgrade your plan, simply log into your account on our website and select the “Upgrade Plan” option. From there, you can customize your plan based on your needs and budget. Once you have selected a plan that works for you, simply click “Submit” and we will take care of the rest!

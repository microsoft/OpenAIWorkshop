Customer:

Hello, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm interested in downgrading my service. I'm wondering if you can help me with that?

Agent:

Good morning, and thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. We are happy to help you with your request. Could you please tell me more about what services you are looking to downgrade?

Customer:

Yes, I'm interested in downgrading my TV service. Can you tell me more about the options available?

Agent: 
Sure! We offer several different packages for TV service, ranging from basic packages to premium packages. Depending on the package you choose, you will have access to different levels of channels and services. Which package are you currently subscribed to?

Customer: 
I'm currently subscribed to the premium package, which includes access to all the channels. Is there a way I can downgrade my package without losing all of these channels?

Agent: 
Yes, we can definitely help you downgrade your package without losing all of your channels. We have several packages that will allow you to keep some of the channels that come with your current premium package, while still reducing your overall cost. Would you like me to explain the different packages and their features? 

Customer: 
Yes please! That would be great. 

Agent: 
Of course! Our basic package offers access to over 50 popular channels at a reduced cost compared to our premium package. If that is not enough for you, we also have our mid-tier package which offers access to over 75 popular channels at an even lower cost than our basic package. Finally, we also have our premium plus package which includes access to over 100 popular channels at a discounted rate compared to our regular premium package.  Which of these packages would you like more information about? 

Customer: 
I'm interested in learning more about the mid-tier package. Can you tell me more about what channels are included in this package? 

Agent: 
Absolutely! Our mid-tier package includes access to over 75 popular channels such as ESPN, TNT, TBS, Lifetime, A&E, AMC and many more. You will also have access to on-demand content and streaming services like Netflix and Hulu at no additional cost. Does this sound like something that interests you? 

Customer: 
Yes it does! I think this might be a good option for me. What is the cost of this package compared to my current one? 

Agent: 
The mid-tier package is significantly cheaper than your current premium package. The monthly cost for this package is only $39.99 per month compared to your current rate of $59.99 per month. Does this sound like something that interests you? 

Customer: 
Definitely! It sounds like a great deal and I think I'd like to go ahead and downgrade my service to the mid-tier package. Is there anything else I need to know before I make the switch? 

Agent: 
No, there's nothing else you need to know before making the switch. All you need to do is confirm your selection and we'll take care of the rest! Are there any other questions or concerns I can help you with today?

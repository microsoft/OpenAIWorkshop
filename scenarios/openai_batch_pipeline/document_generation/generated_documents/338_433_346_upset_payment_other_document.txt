Customer:

Good morning, I am having an issue with my payment. I recently purchased a product from Contoso Wireless, but I'm not sure if the payment went through or not. Can you please help me?

Agent:

Good morning! I'm sorry to hear that you are having issues with your payment. Let me help you get this sorted out. What is the product you purchased and when did you make the purchase?

Customer: 

I purchased a new cell phone about three days ago. I tried to pay for it online but I'm not sure if the payment went through or not. 

Agent: 

I see, no worries. Can you provide me with your order number so I can look into it for you? 

Customer: 

Yes, here is my order number [XXXX]. 

Agent: 

Thanks for that information. Let me check the records and see what's going on with your payment. Please give me one moment while I look into this for you.

 Agent: 

 Okay, I've looked into it and it looks like your payment did go through. The charge should show up on your credit card statement in the next few days. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

 Customer: 

 Yes, actually I was wondering if there are any other products available from Contoso Wireless that I may be interested in? 

 Agent: 

 Absolutely! We have a wide range of products available, from smartphones to tablets and more. Do you have something specific in mind that you're looking for?

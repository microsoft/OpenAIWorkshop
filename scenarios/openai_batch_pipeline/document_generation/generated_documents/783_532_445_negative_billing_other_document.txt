Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience, but it looks like this was an accidental charge due to an error in our system. I can refund you the full amount of $49.99 right away." 

Customer: 
"That's great! But can you tell me how this happened in the first place? How did I end up being charged for something I didn't order?" 

Agent: 
"I apologize for the confusion. It appears that our system accidentally associated your account with another customer who did order the item. We are currently working to improve our system to prevent similar mistakes from occurring in the future." 

Customer: 
"I see. Is there anything else that can be done to prevent this from happening again? This is really frustrating and inconvenient." 

Agent: 
"I completely understand your frustration, and we are doing our best to ensure similar issues don't occur in the future. In addition to improving our system, we also have a team dedicated to double-checking all orders before they are processed to make sure they are accurate."

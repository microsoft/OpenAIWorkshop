Hello, I'm having trouble with my Contoso Wireless product. Can you please help me?

Agent:
Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of issue are you having?

Customer:
I'm not sure what's wrong. It's just not working correctly. I'm frustrated because I've had this product for several months and now it's not working as expected. 

Agent:
I understand your frustration. Can you please provide more details about the issue? What kind of product do you have and what kind of problem are you having? 

Customer: 
I have the Contoso Wireless Portable Hotspot and it's not connecting to the internet properly. I can't seem to get it to work and I've tried all the troubleshooting tips on your website. 

Agent: 
Okay, let me take a look at the issue. Could you please confirm your device model number? 

Customer: 
Yes, it's CW-PHS001. 

Agent: 
Thanks for providing that information. Can you tell me if the device is powering up correctly and connecting to the network? 

Customer: 
Yes, it is powering up correctly and it does show that it is connected to the network but when I try to use it, nothing happens. I can't access any websites or apps. 

Agent: 
I see. That sounds like a connection issue. Could you please try restarting the device and see if that helps? You can also try resetting the network settings on your device if that doesn't work. 

Customer: 
Okay, I'll give that a try. Thanks for your help!

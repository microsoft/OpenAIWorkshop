Customer: 
"I just bought a phone from Contoso Wireless and I'm having some trouble with the payment. Can you help me out?"

Agent: 
"Certainly, I'm here to help. What kind of issues are you experiencing?"

Customer: 
"Well, I just got my first bill and it's twice what I was expecting. It's way too much for me to pay all at once."

Agent: 
"I understand. Let me take a look and see if I can find out what's going on. Can you tell me what phone you purchased?"

Customer: 
"Yeah, it's the newest model of the iPhone XR."

Agent: 
"Okay, let me check the records. Can you tell me when you purchased the phone?"

Customer: 
"It was about two weeks ago."

Agent: 
"Alright, I'm seeing here that your phone was purchased on a two-year contract. That means that the full cost of the phone is spread out over 24 months in addition to your monthly service fees." 

Customer: 
"But why is it so much higher than I was expecting? I thought the phone would only cost $600." 

Agent: 
"The $600 is just the down payment on the phone. The rest of the cost is spread out over the two-year contract, so that's why your bill is higher than expected." 

Customer: 
"That doesn't make any sense. Why wasn't I told about this before I signed up for the contract?" 

Agent: 
"We apologize for any confusion. When you signed up for the contract, we should have informed you that there would be additional costs associated with the phone over time. We can certainly work with you to find a payment plan that works best for your budget."

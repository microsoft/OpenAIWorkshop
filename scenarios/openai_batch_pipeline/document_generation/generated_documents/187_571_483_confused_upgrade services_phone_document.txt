Customer: Hi, I am trying to figure out how to upgrade my phone with Contoso Wireless. 

Agent: Hi there! I'm glad you've come to us for your upgrade. Can I start by asking which phone you currently have? 

Customer: I have the Contoso W200.

Agent: Perfect, the W200 is a great phone! Can I ask what you're looking to upgrade to? 

Customer: I'm not sure yet, I was hoping to get some advice on the best option.

Agent: Of course! We have several great options available. Would you like me to go over them with you? 

Customer: Sure, that would be great. 

Agent: Alright, let's start with the Contoso W300. It's our latest flagship model and has all the latest features including a larger display, faster processor, and improved battery life. It's also compatible with all our wireless plans. 

Customer: That sounds great! What about other options? 

Agent: We also offer the Contoso W400 which is our mid-range model. It has a slightly smaller display than the W300 but still offers great performance and battery life. The W400 is also compatible with our wireless plans. 

Customer: Okay, what about pricing? 

Agent: The W300 retails for $499 while the W400 retails for $399. Both phones are eligible for our upgrade program which offers discounts when you trade in your old device. 

Customer: That's helpful, thank you! Are there any other models I should consider? 

Agent: Sure! We also have the Contoso W500 which is our entry-level model. It has a smaller display than the other two models but still offers good performance and battery life. The W500 retails for $299 and is also eligible for our upgrade program discounts. 

Customer: That's great! Can you tell me more about the upgrade program? 

Agent: Absolutely! Our upgrade program allows customers to trade in their old devices for discounts on new devices. You can get up to $100 off when you trade in your old device. Does that answer your question? 

Customer: Yes, thank you! That's very helpful information.

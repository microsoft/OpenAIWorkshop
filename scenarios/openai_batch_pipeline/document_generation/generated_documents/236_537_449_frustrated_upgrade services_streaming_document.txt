Hello, this is the Contoso Wireless customer service line. How may I help you? 

Customer: 
Yes, hello. I'm trying to upgrade my streaming services, but I'm having some trouble with it. It's been incredibly frustrating. Can you help? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, of course! We'd be happy to assist you with your upgrade. Could you please tell me a bit more about what issues you're having? 

Customer: 
Well, I've been trying to get the streaming services up and running for over an hour now and nothing seems to be working. The instructions that came with the product were very unclear and I'm not sure what to do next. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I'm sorry to hear that you've been having such difficulty with the upgrade process. We'll do our best to get it sorted out for you as quickly as possible. Could you please provide me with some more details on what steps you've taken so far? 

Customer: 
Sure. Well, I've followed all the instructions that came with the product and I've plugged in all the necessary cables, but it still won't work. I've tried restarting the device multiple times and even reinstalling the software, but nothing seems to be helping. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Ok, thank you for providing us with this information. It sounds like we may need to take a look at your device in order to see what's going on here. Could you please confirm your address so that we can arrange for a technician to come out and take a look at it? 

Customer: 
Yes, of course. My address is 123 Main Street, Anytown, USA 12345. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Ok, thank you for confirming your address. We'll have a technician out to take a look at your device within the next 24 hours. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: 
No, that should be all for now. Thank you for your help!

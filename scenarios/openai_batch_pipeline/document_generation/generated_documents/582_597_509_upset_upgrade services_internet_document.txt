Hello, I'm having some issues with my Contoso Wireless internet connection. It's been really slow lately and I'm considering upgrading my service plan. Can you tell me more about the upgrade options?

Agent:

Good afternoon! We apologize for the slow connection. We understand how important it is to have reliable internet service and we're here to help. We offer several upgrade plans that are designed to provide faster internet speeds and better reliability. Would you like to hear more about them? 

Customer: 
Yes please, I'm interested in what you have to offer. What kind of speeds can I expect with an upgrade? 

Agent: 
Great! Our upgraded plans offer a variety of speeds depending on your needs. Our fastest plan offers up to 500 Mbps download speed, while our basic plan offers up to 25 Mbps download speed. Is there a particular speed that you're looking for? 

Customer: 
500 Mbps sounds great, but I'm worried about the cost. How much will this upgrade cost me? 

Agent: 
The cost of the upgrade depends on the plan you choose. Our fastest plan starts at $89.99 per month, while our basic plan starts at $49.99 per month. We also offer discounts for customers who bundle their internet services with other Contoso products such as TV or phone service. Would you like to hear more about these options? 

Customer: 
Yes, that sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about these bundles? 

Agent: 
Sure thing! Our bundles offer additional savings when you combine two or more Contoso services into one package. For example, if you bundle our internet service with our TV service, you can save up to $20 per month on your monthly bill. We also offer discounts for customers who sign up for an annual plan instead of a monthly plan. Are you interested in hearing more about these options? 

Customer: 
Yes, please tell me more about the annual plans. 

Agent: 
Absolutely! Our annual plans offer additional savings when compared to our monthly plans, and they come with added perks such as free installation and free activation fees. The cost of an annual plan depends on the type of services you choose, but generally speaking they start at $599 per year for our basic plan and $899 per year for our fastest plan. Are you interested in hearing more about these plans?

Agent: Thank you for providing your account information. I will look into this right away and get back to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, can you tell me more about the type of internet product you purchased?

Customer: Yes, it was the basic internet package from Contoso Wireless. It was supposed to provide speeds up to 10 Mbps, but it rarely ever reaches that speed.

Agent: I understand your frustration with the speeds not meeting expectations. Let me investigate this further and see if there are any adjustments that need to be made to your account in order to improve performance. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today? 

Customer: Yes, actually. Can you explain why my internet connection is so unreliable? It cuts out multiple times a day and it's really frustrating!

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help.

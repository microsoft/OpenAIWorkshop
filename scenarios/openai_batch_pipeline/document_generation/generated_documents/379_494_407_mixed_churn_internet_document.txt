Customer: Hi, I'm having some trouble with Contoso Wireless' internet service.

Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what seems to be the problem?

Customer: Sure. I've been experiencing a lot of slowdowns and outages lately. It's been very frustrating.

Agent: I understand. That's not something we want our customers to experience. Let me take a look at your account and see what we can do to help you.

Customer: Okay, that would be great. 

Agent: Alright, it looks like we can give you a better plan with more bandwidth for no additional cost. Would that help with the issues you're having? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great. Can you tell me more about this plan? 

Agent: Absolutely! The plan comes with unlimited data and speeds up to 25 Mbps, so it should help with any slowdowns or outages you've been experiencing. 

Customer: That sounds perfect! How long will it take to activate the plan? 

Agent: We can get the plan activated right away! All we need to do is confirm your account information and the plan will be active in 24-48 hours. 

Customer: That's great! So what will this new plan cost? 

Agent: You're in luck - there's no additional cost for this new plan! Your current monthly bill won't change at all, so you'll still be paying the same amount each month for better internet service. 

Customer: Wow, that's amazing! What would have happened if I decided to cancel my service? 

Agent: If you decided to cancel your service, we would have refunded any unused portion of your monthly bill and waived any early termination fees. However, I'm glad you decided to stay with us - the new plan should make a big difference in your internet experience!

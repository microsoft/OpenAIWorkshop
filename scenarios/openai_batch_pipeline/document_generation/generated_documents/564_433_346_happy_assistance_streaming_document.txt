Customer: Hi, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm having trouble streaming your product. Can you help me? 

Agent: Hi there, I'm happy to help. What kind of issue are you having with streaming? 

Customer: Well, it keeps buffering and sometimes the audio isn't working properly. 

Agent: I see. That can be frustrating. Can you tell me what device you're using to stream the product? 

Customer: Sure, I'm using a laptop with Windows 10 installed on it. 

Agent: Okay, that should work fine with our streaming service. Are you connected to a stable wifi connection? 

Customer: Yes, I am connected to a strong wifi connection. 

Agent: Alright, it sounds like the issue may be related to the browser or streaming app you're using. Are you using our streaming app or another browser? 

Customer: I'm using the Contoso Wireless streaming app. 

Agent: Okay, let's try this then. Could you please try clearing your browser's cache and cookies? That should help resolve any issues you may be having with streaming our product. 

Customer: Sure thing! Is there anything else I can do to help with the issue? 

Agent: If clearing your browser's cache and cookies doesn't work, try restarting your device and then reopening the Contoso Wireless streaming app. That should help get the streaming service running smoothly again. 

Customer: Great! Thanks for the help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can do for you today?

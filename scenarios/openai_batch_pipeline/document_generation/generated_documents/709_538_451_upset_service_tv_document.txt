Customer Service Agent: Welcome to Contoso Wireless, how may I help you today?

Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a new TV from your store and the service has been terrible.

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for any inconvenience you have experienced. Can you tell me more about the issue?

Customer: Well, I bought the TV a few weeks ago and it's already stopped working. I've called the store twice now but no one has been able to help me. It's really frustrating.

Customer Service Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me look into this for you and see what I can do. Can you provide me with the serial number of your TV so that I can take a closer look?

Customer: Yes, here it is [serial number]. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for providing me with the serial number. Let me take a look and see what I can do for you. In the meantime, can you tell me a bit more about the problem? Are there any lights on or any indicators that the TV is still working?

Customer: No, there are no lights or indicators that it's working. It just won't turn on. I've tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, but nothing changes. 

Customer Service Agent: Ok, I understand. We'll need to take a closer look at the issue and see what we can do to get it fixed. Unfortunately, it may take some time before we can get this sorted out as we'll need to troubleshoot the issue first. In the meantime, would you like us to send a replacement TV while we work on fixing this one? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great. How long will it take to get a replacement? 

Customer Service Agent: We should be able to have one sent out within 2-3 business days. We'll also make sure to send out an email confirming the order once it's been processed. 

Customer: That sounds great, thank you for your help! 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Hi there, I'm having a problem with my Contoso Wireless account.

Agent: Hello there! How can I help you with your account?

Customer: Well, I recently signed up for the Contoso Wireless TV package and I'm having some trouble setting it up. Can you help me out?

Agent: Absolutely! What seems to be the issue?

Customer: Well, I've been trying to access the streaming service for about an hour now but I keep getting an error message.

Agent: That's not good. Could you please tell me the exact error message that you're getting?

Customer: It says "Error 401: Access Denied".

Agent: Hmm, that's odd. Let me take a look into this and see what's going on. Can you please confirm your account details for me?

Customer: Sure. My account number is 567-890-123 and my username is John Doe.

Agent: Perfect, thank you for that information. Let me just take a look into this and see what's going on. In the meantime, would you like me to walk you through the setup process again? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great! 

Agent: Alright, no problem! First of all, you'll need to make sure that your device is connected to the internet. After that, open up the Contoso TV app and sign in with your account details. You should then be able to access the streaming service. 

Customer: Okay, I've done all of that but it's still not working. 

Agent: Alright, let's take a look at a few other things. Could you please tell me which device you're using to access the service? 

Customer: Yes, it's an Apple iPad Pro. 

Agent: Okay, great! Let me just take a look at our compatibility list and see if there are any known issues with that device. In the meantime, could you please try clearing your browser cache and restarting the app? That should help resolve any temporary issues that may be causing this error message. 

Customer: Alright, I'll give it a try! 

Agent: Great! Please let me know how it goes and if it doesn't work then I can investigate further into this issue for you.

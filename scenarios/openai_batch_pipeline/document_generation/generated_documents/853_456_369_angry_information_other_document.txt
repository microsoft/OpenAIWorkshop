Customer:
"I am so angry right now! I bought your product Other last week and it hasn't worked since the day I bought it. What is going on here? I want answers!"

Agent:
"I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. Can you please tell me more about the issue you're having with your product Other?"

Customer:
"Yes, I can. It won't turn on at all. The power light isn't even coming on when I plug it in. This is ridiculous!"

Agent: 
"I understand your frustration, sir. Have you tried troubleshooting the issue?"

Customer: 
"Of course I have! I followed all the steps in the user manual and nothing worked. I even took it to a local electronics store and they couldn't figure out what was wrong either."

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. We take pride in providing our customers with quality products that work as expected. Can you tell me more about what has been happening with your product?"

Customer: 
"It's been a nightmare! I've spent hours trying to get it to work and nothing has worked. It's like it's broken or something."

Agent: 
"I understand your frustration, sir. Can you please tell me when you purchased the product and where?"

Customer: 
"I bought it from your online store last week. I haven't had any problems with any of your other products before, so this is really disappointing."

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. We take pride in providing our customers with quality products that work as expected. Can you please provide me with your order number so that we can investigate this further?"

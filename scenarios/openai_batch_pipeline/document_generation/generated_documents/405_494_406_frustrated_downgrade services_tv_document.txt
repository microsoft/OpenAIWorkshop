Customer: Hi there, I'm having some issues with my service and I was hoping to get some help.

Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that. How can I help you today?

Customer: I signed up for your Contoso Wireless TV package a few weeks ago and it's been nothing but problems. It keeps freezing and buffering and the picture quality is terrible. I want to downgrade my package to something that works better.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that you're having difficulties with our TV package. Can you tell me what type of device you're using to watch the TV package? 

Customer: Yes, I'm using a Roku device. 

Agent: Alright, we'll look into this for you. In the meantime, I can offer you an alternative package at a lower price if you would like to downgrade your service. We have a basic cable package that may be better suited for your needs. It comes with over 100 channels and offers HD quality streaming. 

Customer: That sounds great! What's the cost of the package? 

Agent: The basic cable package is $50 per month. It also comes with access to on-demand content so you can watch your favorite shows anytime you want. 

Customer: That sounds like a good deal. How long does it take to switch my current package to the new one? 

Agent: The switch should be completed within 1-2 business days. Once we've received your request, we'll send out a technician to install the necessary equipment for the new package and then we'll get your account switched over as quickly as possible. 

Customer: Okay great, I'd like to switch over then please. 

Agent: No problem! We'll get that taken care of right away for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all thank you!

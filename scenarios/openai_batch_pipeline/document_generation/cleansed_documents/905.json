The agent asked the customer to check if the power cord was plugged in correctly and to unplug and replug the TV, which did not work. The agent then asked the customer about the type of outlet they were using and if there was a reset button or switch that needed to be pressed. When the customer said no, the agent suggested trying a different outlet.",

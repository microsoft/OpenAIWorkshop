    "summary": "\n\nThe customer contacted Contoso Wireless customer service about a TV they recently purchased that was not working properly. The customer service agent apologized for the inconvenience and asked the customer for details about the issue. The customer explained that the TV would not turn on when they pressed the power button. The customer service agent suggested unplugging it from the wall and plugging it back in to see if that helps, but when that did not work they asked for the customer's contact information so they could look into it further and get back to them. The customer provided their contact information and the customer service agent assured them they would be in touch shortly with an update.",

The agent offered assistance and asked the customer to explain the issue they were having. After confirming that the router was properly plugged into a power outlet and that the power switch was in the 'on' position, the agent suggested unplugging and replugging the router, as well as resetting it by pressing and holding down the reset button for 15 seconds. The customer agreed to try these methods and thanked the agent for their help.",

## Overview of Question Answering

One of the best ways to get the model to respond specific answers is to improve the format of the prompt. As covered before, a prompt could combine instructions, context, input, and output indicator to get improved results. While these components are not required, it becomes a good practice as the more specific you are with instruction, the better results you will get. Below is an example of how this would look following a more structured prompt. Given the often factual nature that Question-Answering requires, we should make a quick review of some of our [hyperparameters pointers](../98_Hyperparameters_Overview.md) that can be used to control the output.

> **Note:** In short, the lower the `temperature` the more deterministic the results in the sense that the highest probable next token is always picked. Increasing temperature could lead to more randomness encouraging more diverse or creative outputs. We are essentially increasing the weights of the other possible tokens. In terms of application, we might want to use lower temperature for something like fact-based QA to encourage more factual and concise responses. For poem generation or other creative tasks it might be beneficial to increase temperature.

Give the above, it may make sense to investigate the `temperature` hyperparameter to see how it affects the output.

> **Note:** The `temperature` has been to `=0.25` per the recommendation above and the `max_tokens' has been set to ='1200' to allow for a greater prompt length.

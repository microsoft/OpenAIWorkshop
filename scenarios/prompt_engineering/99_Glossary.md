# Exercise 4E: Glossary (Read-Only)

Azure OpenAI Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 excel in natural language tasks by generating coherent text. Prompt engineering optimizes input prompts to influence model outputs effectively for desired responses.

*language model (LM)*
```
A probability distribution over sequences of words
```

*large language model (LLM)*
```
A large language model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model that can perform a variety of 
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including generating and classifying text, answering 
questions in a conversational manner and translating text from one language to another.

The label "large" refers to the number of values (parameters) the model can change autonomously as it learns.
```

*natural language processing (NLP)*
```
Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program to understand spoken and written human language.

NLP programming automates the translation process between computers and humans by manipulating unstructured data (words)
in the context of a specific task (conversation). An important goal of NLP is to help the computer comprehend 
the intent -- as well as the meaning -- of a human being's written or spoken words.
```

*prompt*
```
A piece of text that is used to initiate or provide context for the generation of output
This could be an input sentence, question, or topic to generate a response from the language model.
```

*prompt engineering*
```
The discipline concerned with developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs)
and large language models (LLMs).
```

*token(s)*
```
The token is an abstraction that is defined by external rules to identify the unit of processing in an NLP task.
A token may be a word, part of a word, or just characters like punctuation. (e.g. 'abc ', 'abc.', ' st', etc)
```

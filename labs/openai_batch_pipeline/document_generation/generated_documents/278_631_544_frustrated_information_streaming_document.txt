Customer Service Agent: Hi there, my name is [Name], and I'm a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, I'm really frustrated because I can't figure out how to stream with your product. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely. Let me see what I can do to help you out. What type of streaming are you trying to do?

Customer: I'm trying to stream movies and TV shows, but I can't figure out how to get it to work.

Customer Service Agent: Okay, let's take a look. First off, have you checked that your device is connected to the internet?

Customer: Yes, it's connected and everything seems to be working fine.

Customer Service Agent: Alright, in that case let's try a few other things. Have you tried updating the software on your device? That could help with streaming issues.

Customer: Yes, I've already done that. It didn't help.

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let's take a look at the settings on your device then. Do you know how to access the settings menu?

Customer: Yes, I know how to access the settings menu. 

Customer Service Agent: Great! Let's take a look at the streaming settings then and make sure they're set up correctly. Can you tell me what they're currently set at? 

Customer: Sure, they're set at 1080p resolution and 5Mbps bitrate. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, those settings should be fine for streaming movies and TV shows. Is there anything else we should check? 

Customer: Well, I've also tried connecting my device directly to the router via an ethernet cable but it still doesn't work. 

Customer Service Agent: That could be an issue with your router or modem then. Have you tried resetting them? That might help with the streaming issue. 

Customer: No, I haven't tried resetting them yet. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, let's give that a try then. Can you please disconnect your router from the power source and wait for 30 seconds before plugging it back in again? This will reset it and hopefully resolve the streaming issue as well. 

Customer: Okay, sure thing. I'll give it a try and let you know if it works or not. 

 Customer Service Agent: Perfect! Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you or if you need any further assistance with your streaming issue.

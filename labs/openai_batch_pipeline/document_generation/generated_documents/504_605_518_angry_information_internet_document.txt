Hello, I am calling to get some information about Contoso Wireless's internet. I have been trying to connect to the internet for days and I am getting really frustrated. Can you help me?

Agent:
Good afternoon! I apologize for the inconvenience you are having connecting to the internet. I would be more than happy to help you with that. Can you please provide me with your account information so that I can look into this further?

Customer: 
Yes, my account number is 84568-0021. Please help me understand what is going on with my internet connection. 

Agent:
I certainly understand your frustration and I apologize again for any inconvenience this has caused you. Let me take a look at your account and see what I can find out about your internet connection. Please hold while I look into this further. 

Customer: 
Ok, I will hold on.

Agent: 
Thank you for holding. After looking into your account, it appears that your internet connection is working properly and there are no issues with your service. However, it looks like there may be a problem with your modem or router that is preventing you from connecting to the internet. Do you have access to another modem or router that you could use to test if the issue is with your modem or router? 

Customer: 
Yes, I do have access to another modem and router but why would it suddenly stop working? This is very frustrating and it's causing me a lot of problems! 

Agent: 
I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. It's possible that the modem or router may need to be reset or updated in order for it to function properly again. If you are able to access another modem or router, then we can try troubleshooting the issue further by testing if the issue is with your modem or router. 

Customer: 
Ok, so what should I do next? This is really starting to become a hassle and I'm not sure how much more of this I can take! 

Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this can be and apologize again for any inconvenience this has caused you. The best way to determine if the issue is with your modem or router is by testing it with another modem or router. If the issue persists after using a different modem or router, then we can start looking into other possibilities as well. Do you have access to another modem or router that we can use for testing purposes?

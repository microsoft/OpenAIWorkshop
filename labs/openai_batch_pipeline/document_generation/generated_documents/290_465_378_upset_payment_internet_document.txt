Hello, I am having some issues with my Contoso Wireless internet service. I have been billed twice this month and I'm not sure why. Can you help me out?

Agent: 
Hi there, I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take a look into this for you. Can you please provide me with your account information?

Customer: 
Yes, my account number is 837463937 and my name is John Doe. 

Agent: 
Thanks for providing the information. I'm seeing that you were billed twice for the same service on the 5th of this month. Is that correct? 

Customer: 
Yes, that is correct. It's quite confusing to me why I would be billed twice for the same service in one month. Is there any way to get a refund? 

Agent: 
I apologize for the double billing. It looks like we can process a refund for one of the payments. Would you like me to do that? 

Customer: 
Yes, please go ahead and process the refund. I really appreciate it. 

Agent: 
No problem, I will go ahead and process the refund right away. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: 
Actually, yes there is something else. Can you tell me more about Contoso Wireless internet service? What speeds are offered and what kind of coverage do they provide?

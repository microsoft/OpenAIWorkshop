Customer:
Hello, I'm having trouble with the internet connection on my Contoso Wireless product. I've had it for a few months now, but the connection keeps dropping. I'm getting really frustrated with it. Can you help me?

Agent:
Hello there! I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll do our best to get you up and running again. Could you tell me more about what you're experiencing? 

Customer:
Well, like I said, my internet connection keeps dropping. It's especially bad when I'm streaming or downloading something. It will just suddenly disconnect without warning and then it takes a few minutes before I can reconnect again. 

Agent:
I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Let me take a look at your account and see if there's anything we can do to help improve the connection for you. 

Customer: 
That would be great! What do you need from me? 

Agent: 
I'll need some information from your account in order to start troubleshooting the issue. Can you please provide me with your account number, as well as the name of your Contoso Wireless product? 

Customer: 
Sure, my account number is XXXXXX and my Contoso Wireless product is called the Contoso Plus 4G LTE. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing that information. I'll start looking into this right away and see what we can do to help improve your connection. In the meantime, could you tell me a bit more about how often your connection drops? 

Customer: 
It's pretty frequent - at least a couple of times a day, sometimes even more than that. It's really annoying because it interrupts whatever I'm doing and I have to wait for it to reconnect before I can continue. 

Agent: 
I completely understand your frustration and we'll do our best to get this resolved for you as quickly as possible. To help us further narrow down the issue, could you tell me what type of device you're using with your Contoso Wireless product? 

Customer: 
I'm using an Apple iPhone 6S Plus with iOS 11 installed on it. Does that help? 

Agent: 
Yes, thank you for providing that information. We'll use this to further investigate the issue and try to find a solution that works for you. In the meantime, is there anything else that we should be aware of when it comes to your internet connection? 

Customer: 
Well, the connection seems to drop more often when I'm in an area with low signal strength or if there are too many people using the same network at once. Other than that, no - that's pretty much all I've noticed so far. 

Agent: 
Okay, thank you for letting us know that. We'll keep these things in mind as we work on resolving your issue. In the meantime, could you please stay on this line while we work on finding a solution? That way, we can make sure that everything is working properly once we're done troubleshooting.

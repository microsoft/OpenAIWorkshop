[A few moments later]

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for holding. I've checked our system and it looks like there was an issue with the signal strength in your area. We are currently working to resolve the issue and should have it fixed soon. 

Customer: That's not good enough! This has been going on for weeks now and it's really affecting my ability to work from home. What are you doing to fix this problem?

Customer Service Agent: We understand your frustration and we are doing everything we can to fix the issue as quickly as possible. We have dispatched technicians to your area to investigate the signal strength and they are actively working to resolve the issue. 

Customer: That's still not good enough! How long is this going to take? I need a reliable connection now! 

Customer Service Agent: Our technicians are working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, but due to the complexity of the issue it could take a few days before it is fully resolved. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. 

Customer: This is unacceptable! I'm paying for a service that isn't being delivered! What kind of compensation can you offer me? 

Customer Service Agent: We understand your frustration and we want to make sure that you are satisfied with our services. We can offer you a month of free service once the issue is resolved as compensation for your inconvenience. 

Customer: That's still not enough. What else can you do? 

Customer Service Agent: We understand your frustration and we want to make sure that you are satisfied with our services. In addition to a month of free service, we can also provide you with a one-time credit towards any future purchases from Contoso Wireless. Would that be acceptable? 

Customer: Yes, that would be acceptable. Thank you for your help in resolving this issue.

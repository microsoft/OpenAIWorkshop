Customer: Hi, I'm looking for some assistance.

Agent: Hi there! How can I help you?

Customer: I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless TV and I'm having some issues with it. 

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of issues are you having?

Customer: Well, the picture keeps freezing up, and the sound is distorted.

Agent: That sounds very strange. Can you please provide me with your model number so I can look into this further? 

Customer: Sure, it's model number 456-222-098. 

Agent: Alright, thank you for that information. Let me take a look and see what we can do to help. Please hold while I check on this for you. 

[A few moments pass] 

Agent: Okay, so it looks like the issue may be related to the signal strength in your area. We suggest that you try to move the TV closer to a window to increase signal strength and see if that helps with the picture quality and sound issues. 

Customer: That makes sense, but what about if that doesn't work? 

Agent: If that doesn't work, then we suggest you contact your local service provider to see if they can provide any assistance in boosting signal strength in your area. They may be able to provide a signal booster or other technical support services to help resolve the issue. 

Customer: Alright, that sounds good. Is there anything else I should try? 

Agent: Yes, if possible, try resetting the TV by unplugging it from the power source for at least 30 seconds before plugging it back in again. This should reset any settings and may help with resolving the issue as well. 

Customer: Okay, thank you for your help. I'll give those things a try and see what happens. 

Agent: You're welcome! If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out again. Have a great day!

Hi, I recently purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and I was wondering if I could downgrade the service plan I have with it?

Contoso Wireless Customer Service Agent:
Hello, and thank you for your purchase! We are glad to help you with any concerns or questions you may have. Could you tell me a little bit more about the phone and why you would like to downgrade your service plan? 

Customer: 
I recently bought a Contoso Wireless phone but I don't need all of the features that come with the service plan. The phone is quite expensive, so I wanted to save some money by downgrading my plan. 

Contoso Wireless Customer Service Agent:
I understand. Downgrading your service plan could help you save money, but it is important to consider what features you will be giving up if you downgrade. What are some of the features that you would like to keep? 

Customer: 
I'd like to keep the data allowance and international calling. I don't need unlimited text messages or extra data plans. 

Contoso Wireless Customer Service Agent:
That's understandable. Depending on your current service plan, we may be able to downgrade it without losing those two features. Can you tell me what type of phone and service plan you currently have? 

Customer: 
I have the Contoso 6s Plus phone and the Unlimited Plus Plan. 

Contoso Wireless Customer Service Agent:
Okay, let me see what options we can offer you for downgrading your plan while still keeping the data allowance and international calling features. Can you give me a few minutes while I look into this? 

Customer: 
Sure, no problem. 

Contoso Wireless Customer Service Agent: 
Great! After looking through our options, we can offer you our Unlimited Standard Plan which includes unlimited calls and texts in the US, 5GB of high-speed data, and international calling at a discounted rate. Does this sound like something that would work for you? 

Customer: 
Yes, that sounds perfect! How do I go about downgrading my plan? 

Contoso Wireless Customer Service Agent: 
No problem! To downgrade your plan, all we need to do is contact our billing department and they will help make the change for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

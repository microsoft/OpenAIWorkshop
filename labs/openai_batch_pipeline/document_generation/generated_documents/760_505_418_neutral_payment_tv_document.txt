Customer: Hi there, I'm looking to purchase a new television from Contoso Wireless. Can you tell me a bit more about the product?

Agent: Absolutely! Our televisions are some of the best in the industry and feature top-of-the-line technology. We offer a variety of sizes and styles to suit your needs.

Customer: That sounds great. What kind of payment options do you have available?

Agent: We accept all major credit cards, debit cards, and PayPal. We also have a financing option that allows you to spread out your payments over time with no interest.

Customer: That's great! What is the minimum purchase amount required to qualify for financing?

Agent: The minimum purchase amount is $250, but please keep in mind that you will need to make at least 6 months of payments before the financing option is complete. 

Customer: Ok, I understand. Is there a way for me to pay for my purchase without using a credit or debit card? 

Agent: Yes, we do accept cash and check payments as well. However, these forms of payment must be made in person at one of our retail locations. 

Customer: Got it. What is the return policy if I am not satisfied with my purchase? 

Agent: We offer a 30-day return policy on all our products. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can return it within 30 days for a full refund, minus any shipping and handling fees. 

Customer: That sounds reasonable. Is there anything else I should know before I make my purchase? 

Agent: Yes, please keep in mind that all our products come with a manufacturer's warranty that covers any defects or malfunctions for up to one year from the date of purchase. 

Customer: Great! That's all I need to know for now. Thanks for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can do for you today?

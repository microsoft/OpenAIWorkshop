Customer:  Hi, I'm having an issue with my billing. I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I have a question about your product streaming.

Agent: Hi there! I'm glad you reached out to us. How can I help you with your billing?

Customer: Well, I was wondering if there is any way to get a discount on the product streaming service?

Agent: Absolutely! We offer discounts on our product streaming service for customers who sign up for an annual plan. Would you like to learn more about that option?

Customer: Yes, please! That sounds great. Can you tell me more about the discounts?

Agent: Sure! Our annual plan offers a 25% discount on the product streaming service. This means that instead of paying the full price for 12 months of streaming, you would only have to pay for 9 months worth of service. Does this sound like something that interests you? 

Customer: Wow, that's a great deal! Can I sign up for the annual plan right away? 

Agent: Yes, absolutely! All you have to do is go to our website and select the annual plan option. Once you've completed the sign-up process, you'll be eligible for the 25% discount on the product streaming service. 

Customer: That's great! What happens if I decide that I don't want to keep the plan after signing up? 

Agent: No problem! We understand that plans can change and we are happy to work with our customers. If you decide that you no longer want the annual plan after signing up, simply contact us and we will be able to cancel it for you. 

Customer: Perfect! That sounds really helpful. Is there anything else I should know before signing up for the annual plan? 

Agent: Just one more thing - once you sign up for the annual plan, your billing cycle will change from monthly payments to one annual payment. Does this make sense? 

Customer: Yes, it does. Thank you so much for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

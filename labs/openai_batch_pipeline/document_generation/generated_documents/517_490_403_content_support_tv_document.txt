Customer:

Hello, I'm looking for some help with my Contoso Wireless TV. Can you help me?

Agent:

Of course! I'm here to provide you with the best support possible. What seems to be the problem with your Contoso Wireless TV?

Customer:

I'm having trouble setting it up. I've been trying for a few hours and I can't seem to get it working properly.

Agent:

I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll do our best to get you up and running quickly. Can you tell me more about what you have done so far? 

Customer: 
Yes, I've connected the power cable and the HDMI cable to the TV, but nothing is happening when I turn it on. 

Agent: 
Ok, let's start by making sure that your power cable is connected securely at both ends. Can you please check that? 

Customer: 
Yes, it's connected securely. 

Agent: 
Alright, let's move on to the HDMI cable then. Could you please double check that both ends are firmly plugged in? 

Customer: 
Yes, both ends are plugged in securely. 

Agent: 
OK, now that we've confirmed that all cables are connected properly, let's make sure that your Contoso Wireless TV is receiving power by checking if the LED light is on or not. Can you please take a look at that? 

 Customer:  Yes, the LED light is on. 

 Agent: Great! It looks like your TV is receiving power and all cables are connected properly. Could you please try turning it on again and see if it works this time? 

 Customer: Sure, I'll give it a try. 

 Agent: Alright, please let me know if there are any other issues or if there is anything else I can help you with.

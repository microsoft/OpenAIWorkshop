Sure, my account number is [Number].

Thank you for providing that information. It looks like there is an issue with your account settings that is preventing you from connecting to the internet. I can help you fix this. Can you tell me what type of device you are using?

I'm using an iPhone 6s.

Agent: 
Okay, that's great. The first thing I need you to do is to go into the settings on your phone and make sure that your Contoso Wireless account settings are up-to-date. Once you have done that, please let me know and we can continue troubleshooting from there. 

Customer: 
Alright, I've updated the settings. What's next? 

Agent: 
Great! Now, I need you to go into the network settings on your phone and make sure that the connection type is set to LTE or 4G LTE. This will ensure that your phone is able to connect to the fastest speeds available on our network. Please let me know once you have done this. 

Customer: 
I've changed the connection type to LTE/4G LTE. Is there anything else I need to do? 

Agent: 
Yes, now I need you to go into the security settings on your phone and make sure that the encryption type is set to WPA2. This will ensure that your connection is secure and encrypted. Once you have done this, please let me know and we can continue troubleshooting from there. 

Customer: 
I've updated the encryption type as well. What should I do now? 

Agent: 
Excellent! Now all we need to do is reboot your device so that all of the new settings can take effect. Once your device has restarted, please try connecting again and let me know if it works or not.

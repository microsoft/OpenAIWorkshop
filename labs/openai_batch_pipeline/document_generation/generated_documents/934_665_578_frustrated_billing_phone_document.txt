Customer: Hi, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm having an issue with my billing.

Agent: Hi there, my name is [Agent Name] and I'm a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you with your billing?

Customer: I've been charged twice for the same phone. I received the phone last week and was charged for it but now I see another charge on my account. 

Agent: I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Let me take a look into your account and see what's going on. Could you provide me with your account number?

Customer: Sure, it's [account number]. 

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. Let me take a look into your account. It looks like there was an error when you purchased the phone, and the system charged you twice for the same item. We can refund one of the charges for you. Would you like us to do that? 

Customer: Yes please, that would be great. 

Agent: Certainly. We'll go ahead and process the refund and it should be reflected in your account within 2-3 business days. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: Yes, actually. I'd like to know more about the phone I purchased. What kind of warranty does it come with?

Customer: That's great, thank you! Is there any other information you can tell me about the phone? 

Agent: Sure! The phone comes with a 5 inch HD display, 8MP rear-facing camera, and 16GB of internal storage capacity as well as a microSD card slot that supports up to 128GB of additional storage space. It also has dual-SIM capabilities, allowing you to use two different SIM cards in one device if needed. 

Customer: That sounds great! Is there anything else I should know about this phone?

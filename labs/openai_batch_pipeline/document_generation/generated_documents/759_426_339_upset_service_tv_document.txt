Customer Service Agent: Welcome to Contoso Wireless! How can I help you today? 

Customer: Hi there, I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless TV and it's not working properly. I'm not happy with the product and want to know what I can do to get this fixed. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please provide me with more information about the issue you're experiencing? 

Customer: Sure, when I turn on the TV, the screen flashes but no picture appears. It's just black. 

Customer Service Agent: I see. Have you tried resetting the device? 

Customer: Yes, I've tried resetting it multiple times but nothing seems to work. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let me check if there is a known issue with this model of TV. Can you please confirm your model number for me? 

Customer: Sure, it's model XYZ123. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for providing that information. Let me look into this further and see if there is anything else that can be done to resolve this issue. In the meantime, I can offer you a one-time replacement at no additional cost to you. 

Customer: That would be great! How soon can I expect the replacement? 

Customer Service Agent: We will need some time to process your request and arrange for delivery of the replacement device. We'll be able to ship it out within 5-7 business days. Is that acceptable? 

Customer: Yes, that's acceptable. Thank you for your help!

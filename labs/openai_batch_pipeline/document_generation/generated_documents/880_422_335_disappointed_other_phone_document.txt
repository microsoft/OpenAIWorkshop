Hello, I'm looking for some help with a Contoso Wireless phone. I recently purchased one and I'm having some issues with it.

I understand how frustrating that must be. Can you tell me what type of phone you have and when you purchased it?

I purchased it about a month ago and it's a Contoso Wireless S20.

I see, that's definitely not a good sign. Can you please send us your serial number so we can look into this further for you?

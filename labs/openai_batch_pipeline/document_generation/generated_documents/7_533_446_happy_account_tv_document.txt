Customer: Hi there, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I was wondering if you could help me out. I recently purchased one of your TVs and I'm having some trouble setting it up. Could you help me out?

Agent: Absolutely! I'm happy to help. What kind of trouble are you having?

Customer: Well, I'm having trouble connecting to the internet. It's not recognizing my wireless network.

Agent: That's definitely an issue that we can help with. Is this the first time you've tried to set up your TV?

Customer: Yes, it is. I just got it yesterday and I haven't been able to get it working yet. 

Agent: No worries! Let's see if we can get this sorted out for you. First, can you tell me what type of router you're using?

Customer: Sure, it's a Linksys router. 

Agent: Great, let's start by making sure that your router is broadcasting the signal correctly. Can you check the settings on your router and make sure that the SSID is enabled? 

Customer: Yes, I just checked and it looks like it is enabled. 

Agent: Perfect! Now let's try connecting your TV to the network. Can you tell me what model of TV you have? 

Customer: It's a 55 inch 4K Ultra HD Smart TV from Contoso Wireless. 

Agent: Got it! Now, on your TV remote, press the home button and then select the "Network" option from the menu. Then select "Wireless" as your connection type and enter in the SSID for your router when prompted. 

Customer: Ok, I did all that but now it's asking me for a password. 

Agent: That's because your router is password protected - so enter in the password for your router when prompted and that should do it! 

Customer: Awesome! That worked - thank you so much for your help! 

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

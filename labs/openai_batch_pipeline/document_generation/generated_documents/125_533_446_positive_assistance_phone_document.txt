Customer: Hi, I'm looking for help with a product I purchased from Contoso Wireless.

Agent: Hi there, how can I help?

Customer: I recently bought a phone from Contoso Wireless and I was wondering if there's anything I need to know about the product before I start using it.

Agent: Of course. Let me provide you with all the information you need. First, let me confirm the model of the phone that you purchased.

Customer: It's the new Contoso Wireless GX-3000.

Agent: Perfect. Now, let me tell you about all the features that come with your phone. It has a 5.5 inch full HD screen, a 13 megapixel rear camera, and a 5 megapixel front camera. It also has a fingerprint scanner and runs on the latest Android operating system. 

Customer: Wow, that sounds great! Are there any special instructions I should follow when using my new phone?

Agent: Sure! First, make sure to keep your phone updated with the latest version of Android so that you can get access to all the newest features and security updates. Additionally, be sure to always back up your data in case of any unforeseen events or technical issues. 

Customer: Got it. Anything else? 

Agent: Yes! Make sure to keep your phone away from water or any other liquids to avoid damaging it. Additionally, make sure to not expose your phone to extreme temperatures or any other environmental hazards as this can also damage your device. 

Customer: That makes sense. Is there any warranty that comes with my phone? 

Agent: Absolutely! Your phone comes with a one-year limited warranty that covers any defects in materials or workmanship during normal use of the product within one year from the date of purchase. Please note that this warranty does not cover any damage caused by improper care, mishandling, misuse, or unauthorized modification of the product. 

Customer: That's really helpful to know. Thank you for all the information! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

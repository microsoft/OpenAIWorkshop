Hello, this is [Name] from Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer:
I just bought a new phone from your company and it's not working! I am so frustrated and angry right now. 

Customer Service Agent:
I'm sorry to hear that. We take our customer service very seriously here at Contoso Wireless. Can you tell me more about the issue you're having with the phone? 

Customer:
It won't even turn on! I followed the instructions exactly and nothing is happening. This phone was so expensive and I'm really disappointed. 

Customer Service Agent:
I understand how frustrating this can be. Can you tell me what model of phone you purchased and what troubleshooting steps have you tried? 

Customer:
I bought the new iPhone 11 Pro Max and I've tried plugging it in to charge, restarting it, and even resetting it. Nothing has worked so far. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I see, thank you for that information. What I suggest we do is send you a replacement phone as soon as possible. In the meantime, let's run through a few more troubleshooting steps to try to get your current phone working. 

Customer: 
That sounds great, thank you! What other steps can I try? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Sure thing. First, let's try a hard reset on your phone by pressing and holding both the power button and volume down button until you see the Apple logo appear on the screen. Then, once your phone has restarted, let's try resetting your network settings by going into Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. If that doesn't work, then we can move on to replacing the phone with a new one. 

Customer: 
Okay, got it! I'll give those steps a try and let you know if it works. Thank you for your help!

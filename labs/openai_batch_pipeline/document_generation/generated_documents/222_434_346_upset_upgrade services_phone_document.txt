Customer:
Hello, I'm having an issue with my phone that I purchased from Contoso Wireless. I was told it was an upgrade, but it's not working as promised. Can you help me?

Agent:
Hello, I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please provide me with more information so that I can help you? 

Customer:
Sure. I purchased the Contoso Wireless XZY phone two weeks ago and was told it was the latest model and upgrade. However, the phone is having a lot of trouble connecting to the internet and the battery drains too quickly.

Agent:
I apologize for the trouble you are having. Can you please tell me what kind of internet connection you are using? 

Customer:
Yes, I am using a 4G LTE connection. 

Agent:
Thank you for providing that information. Have you tried restarting your phone or resetting your network settings? 

Customer:
Yes, I have tried both of those things but neither has helped. 

Agent: 
I understand your frustration. Let me check to see if there are any known issues with this model phone and if there is a fix available. Would that be ok? 

Customer: 
Yes, that would be great! Thank you for looking into this for me. 

Agent: 
You're welcome. I will look into this right away and get back to you as soon as possible with an update on the situation. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: 
No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help!

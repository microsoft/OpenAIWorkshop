Customer Service Agent: Hi, my name is John and I'm a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi John, I'm not happy with Contoso Wireless and I'm considering leaving the company. I'm particularly disappointed with the streaming product. Can you explain why it's not working properly?

Customer Service Agent: Of course. I understand your disappointment and apologize for any inconvenience caused. We have been having some issues with our streaming product due to an upgrade we recently made to our system. We are currently working to resolve the issue and should have it fixed soon. 

Customer: That's unacceptable. I pay a lot of money for this service and the streaming should be working properly. When will it be fixed?

Customer Service Agent: We are working as quickly as possible to resolve the issue. We are currently testing the system to ensure that it is functioning correctly and we expect it to be fixed within the next few days. 

Customer: That still doesn't make up for the time I've already lost because of this issue. What can you do to make up for this? 

Customer Service Agent: We apologize for any inconvenience caused and would like to offer you a complimentary one-month subscription to our premium streaming service as an apology for the disruption in service. 

Customer: That's much better, but what are you doing to prevent this from happening again in the future? 

Customer Service Agent: We are currently conducting an internal investigation into what caused the issue and are taking steps to ensure that it does not happen again in the future. We are also investing in additional resources and personnel to improve our streaming service going forward. 

Customer: That's good to hear. Is there anything else you can do for me? 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, we would like to offer you a 10% discount on your next bill as an additional way of apologizing for any inconvenience caused by this issue. 

Customer: That sounds great, thank you. I appreciate your help in resolving this issue.

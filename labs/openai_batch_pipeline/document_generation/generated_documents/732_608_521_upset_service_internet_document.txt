Customer: Hi, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm having a problem with my internet service. It's been down for over an hour now and I can't get any work done. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that your internet service is down. We understand how frustrating it can be when something like this happens. Let me see what I can do to help.

Customer: Great, thank you. What can you do to get my service back up and running?

Agent: First, I'll need to run some tests to see if there's an issue with your connection. Can you tell me where you're located so I can check our network in that area?

Customer: Yes, I'm located in the City of Oaks. 

Agent: Okay, great. Let me check our network in the City of Oaks and see if there are any outages or issues in the area. Can you give me a few minutes while I check?

Customer: Sure, take your time. 

Agent: Thanks for your patience. Okay, after running some tests, it looks like there's an outage in the City of Oaks that is affecting your internet service. We apologize for the inconvenience this is causing and we are working hard to get it resolved as quickly as possible. 

Customer: That's not good enough! How long will it take before my service is back up and running? 

Agent: We are doing our best to restore your service as soon as possible, however, due to the nature of outages it can take some time to resolve them fully. We estimate that it should be back up within the next 2 hours. 

Customer: That's still too long! What about a refund for the lost service? 

Agent: Of course! We understand how important internet access is and we want to make sure you're not left out of pocket due to this outage. We can offer you a credit for the time you've been without service which will be applied to your next bill. 

Customer: Alright, that sounds fair enough. Is there anything else I should know about this outage or when my service will be back up? 

Agent: We are actively working on restoring your service as quickly as possible and we will keep you updated if anything changes or if we discover any additional information about the outage. In the meantime, please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns.

Hello there! My name is [agent name] and I am a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. What seems to be the problem?

Customer:
I recently purchased a new phone from your store and when I tried to activate my account, it says that my account is locked. Is there anything you can do to help me out?

I apologize for the inconvenience. We have a few steps that we can take to try and resolve this issue. Could you please provide me with your full name, address, and the email address associated with your account?

Thank you for providing that information. I'm going to take a look at your account and see if I can find out why it's locked. Please give me just one moment while I check. 

Customer: 
Okay, thank you. 

Agent: 
Alright, it looks like there was an issue with the activation process on your new phone. We can resolve this by resetting your account password. Is that something you would like me to do? 

Customer: 
Yes, please go ahead and reset my password so that I can activate my phone. 

Agent: 
No problem! To reset your password, I'm going to need you to provide me with some additional information about yourself, such as your date of birth and a security question answer. Can you provide those for me? 

Customer: 
Yes, my date of birth is [date of birth] and my security question answer is [answer]. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing that information! Now I'll go ahead and reset your password. Please allow a few moments for the process to complete. 

Customer: 
Okay, thank you for all of your help. Is there anything else that I should know about activating my new phone? 

Agent: 
Yes, once the password has been reset, you'll need to log into your Contoso Wireless account using the new password and then follow the instructions on the activation page in order to successfully activate your new phone.

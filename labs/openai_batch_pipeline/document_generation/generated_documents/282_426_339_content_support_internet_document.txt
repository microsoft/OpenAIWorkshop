Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble with the Contoso Wireless internet. Can you help?

Agent: Absolutely! What seems to be the issue?

Customer: I'm not getting a strong connection and it keeps dropping out.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me what type of device you're using to connect to our network?

Customer: I'm using an iPhone 11.

Agent: Okay, great. Is there anything else that could be affecting your connection? For example, is there any other electronic equipment running in the same area as your phone?

Customer: No, nothing else should be interfering with the connection.

Agent: Alright, let's go ahead and check the signal strength of your device. Can you please open your phone settings and look at the Wi-Fi icon? What does it say under the signal strength bar?

Customer: It says "Excellent". 

Agent: That's good news! Now, let's try resetting your network connection. Can you please turn off your Wi-Fi and then turn it back on again? 

Customer: Sure, one second...okay, done. 

Agent: Great! Is your connection still dropping out? 

Customer: No, it looks like it's working now. 

Agent: Wonderful! I'm glad we were able to resolve this issue for you. Is there anything else I can do for you today? 

Customer: No, that should be it. Thanks for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day!

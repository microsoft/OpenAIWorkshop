Customer:
Hi, I'm interested in upgrading my phone with Contoso Wireless. What services do you offer?

Agent:
Hello! We offer a range of upgrade services at Contoso Wireless. Our most popular service is our phone upgrade program, which allows customers to trade in their old phone for a new one. We also offer discounts on certain phone models and plans when you upgrade. Is there something specific you're looking for?

Customer:
Yes, I'm looking for the newest model of the Contoso phone. Do you have any deals or discounts available on that model? 

Agent:
Yes, we do! We currently have a promotion going on where customers can get $50 off when they upgrade to the newest Contoso phone. This promotion is only available for a limited time, so if you're interested, I recommend taking advantage of it now. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer:
That sounds great! What do I need to do to get the discount? 

Agent:
To get the $50 discount, you'll need to purchase a new phone and sign up for a service plan with us. You'll also need to trade in your old phone to qualify for the discount. Once you've done that, we'll apply the discount automatically when you check out. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in doing? 

Customer: 
Yes, that sounds perfect! Do I need to do anything else? 

Agent: 
No, that's all you need to do. All you have to do is purchase the new phone and sign up for a service plan with us and we'll take care of the rest. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to let me know. 

Customer: 
No, that's all I needed to know. Thanks for your help! 

Agent: 
No problem! It was my pleasure to assist you today. Have a great day!

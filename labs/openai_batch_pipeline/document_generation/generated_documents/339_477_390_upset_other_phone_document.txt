Customer:
Hello, I just received my Contoso Wireless phone and I'm not happy with it. The battery doesn't seem to last very long and I'm really disappointed. 

Agent:
Hello there, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me take a look at your account and see what we can do to help. Can you please tell me your name and the phone model you purchased? 

Customer:
My name is John and I purchased the Contoso Wireless 8 Plus. 

Agent:
Thank you for the information, John. I'll take a look at your account and see what we can do to help. In the meantime, can you tell me what's wrong with the phone? 

Customer:
Well, like I said, the battery doesn't seem to last very long. It only lasts about half a day even when I don't use it very much. Plus, it doesn't seem to be charging properly either. 

Agent:
I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Can you tell me if you've already tried troubleshooting steps such as restarting the device or performing a soft reset? 

Customer:
Yes, I have tried those things but it didn't help. Is there anything else that can be done? 

Agent:
Yes, we can certainly look into further options for you. Before we do that, though, can you confirm if your phone was purchased directly from Contoso Wireless or from an authorized retailer? 

Customer:
It was purchased directly from Contoso Wireless. 

Agent:
Alright, thank you for confirming that information. We'll need to open up a case so we can investigate further into this issue and provide a resolution for you as soon as possible. Can you please provide us with your contact information so we can reach out with an update?

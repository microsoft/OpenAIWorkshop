Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble with my Contoso Wireless phone. Can you help?

Agent: Absolutely! What seems to be the issue?

Customer: Well, I've had this phone for about a month now and my account has been charged twice. I don't understand why that would happen.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take a look into this for you and see what I can find out. Can you please provide me with your account information?

Customer: Sure. My name is John Doe and my account number is 123456789.

Agent: Thank you, Mr. Doe. I'm just going to take a few moments to review your account information.

Agent: Alright, it looks like there were two charges made on your account in the last month. The first charge was for the initial setup of your phone and the second was for a monthly subscription fee that was automatically charged each month. Is this correct? 

Customer: Yes, that's right, but why was it charged twice in one month? 

Agent: It appears that when you set up your account you opted for an automatic monthly subscription payment plan that automatically charges your account each month for the subscription fee. Since you had already set up the plan before the end of the month, it charged your account twice in one month instead of once at the beginning of each month. 

Customer: That doesn't make any sense! How can I stop it from happening again? 

Agent: Of course! You can simply go into your account settings and disable the automatic payment plan option so that it only charges your account once per month instead of twice. 

Customer: Okay, so how do I do that? 

Agent: It's actually very easy! Just log into your Contoso Wireless account and go to the settings page. Then scroll down until you find the option to disable automatic payments. Once you click on it, it should take care of everything and prevent any further double charges from occurring on your account. 

Customer: Alright, I'll give that a try. Thanks for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! If there's anything else we can do for you today, please let us know. Have a great day!

"Hi there, I'm having a major issue with my Contoso Wireless account. I was promised a new product but it never arrived and now I'm being charged for something I didn't receive. Can you please explain what's going on?"

Agent: 
"Good afternoon! I apologize for the inconvenience and am happy to help you with your account. Can you tell me more about the product you were expecting?"

Customer: 
"I was told by one of your representatives that I would be receiving a new phone with my account. It was supposed to be here last week, but it never arrived."

Agent: 
"I apologize for the delay in delivery. We'll need to take a look into this for you. Can you please provide me with your account number so I can look into this further?"

"It's [account number]. I need to know what happened to my order. This is unacceptable!"

"I understand your frustration, [customer name], and I'm sorry that you're having to wait for your product. Let me see what I can find out. In the meantime, can you please provide me with your shipping address and contact information so we can look into this further?"

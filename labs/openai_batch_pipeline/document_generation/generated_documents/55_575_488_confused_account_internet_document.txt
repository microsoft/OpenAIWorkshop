Customer: Hello, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless. I have a question about my account and I'm confused about the product. 

Agent: Hi there, my name is [Agent name], and I'm a customer service representative for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you?

Customer: I was looking at the product page for internet service, but I'm not sure which plan is right for me. Can you explain the differences?

Agent: Absolutely! We offer two plans for our internet service - the Standard plan and the Premium plan. The Standard plan provides up to 10 Mbps download speeds and 1 Mbps upload speeds. The Premium plan offers up to 25 Mbps download speeds and 5 Mbps upload speeds. Both plans include unlimited data and no contract required. 

Customer: That's helpful, thank you. But which one is better?

Agent: That really depends on your needs. The Standard plan is perfect for basic web browsing and streaming video in standard definition. If you're looking for higher quality streaming or faster downloads, then the Premium plan would be better suited for you. 

Customer: Hmm, okay. Can I switch plans if I decide that the one I chose isn't right for me?

Agent: Yes, absolutely! You can switch plans at any time without any additional fees or penalties. All you need to do is log in to your account on our website and select the new plan you'd like to switch to. 

Customer: That's great! Is there anything else I should know about the plans? 

Agent: Yes! Both plans offer a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can try it out risk-free and make sure it meets your needs before committing to it long-term. 

Customer: That's really helpful, thank you! One more question - can I get any discounts on these plans? 

Agent: Yes! We offer a variety of discounts depending on your location and eligibility requirements. For example, we offer a 10% discount for students and seniors, as well as a 15% discount for military personnel and veterans. You can check out all of our available discounts on our website or give us a call at [phone number] to find out if you qualify for any of them. 

Customer: Perfect, thank you so much for your help!

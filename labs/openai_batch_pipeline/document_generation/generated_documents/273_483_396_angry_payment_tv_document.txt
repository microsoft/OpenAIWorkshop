Customer: 

"I'm trying to pay for my new Contoso Wireless TV and I'm having some trouble. Can you help me out?"

Agent: 

"Of course! I'd be more than happy to help you with your payment issue. Can you tell me a bit more about what's going on?"

Customer: 

"Well, I tried to pay with my credit card but it keeps getting declined. I know there's enough money in the account so I don't understand why it's not working."

Agent: 

"That's strange. Are you sure you're entering the right information? If so, then we can take a look at the account and see if there is an issue with your card." 

Customer: 

"Yes, I'm sure. It's the same card I've been using for years. What kind of issue could there be?" 

Agent: 

"It could be that the card has expired or that it has been blocked by your bank for security reasons. We can check both of these possibilities for you." 

Customer: 

"That doesn't make any sense. I just used this card last week and there were no issues then." 

Agent: 

"It's possible that something has changed since then. In the meantime, would you like to try another payment method? We accept PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay." 

Customer: 
"No, I don't want to use any of those. I want to use my credit card. There must be something wrong on your end if it's not working." 

Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating this must be for you. We'll look into this further and see if we can figure out what's going on. Can I ask for some additional information to verify your account?"

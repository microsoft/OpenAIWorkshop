Customer:
"I just received my new phone from Contoso Wireless and it's not what I expected! I wanted the latest version with all the features and now I'm stuck with this outdated model. This is unacceptable! How could you do this to me?"

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience. We are dedicated to providing our customers with the best service possible, and we understand your frustration. Please tell me what happened so we can find a solution."

Customer: 
"Well, I ordered the latest model, but instead I got this old phone. It doesn't have any of the features I wanted, so I'm really disappointed. What are you going to do about it?"

Agent: 
"I understand your concern and I apologize for the confusion. We will be happy to upgrade your phone to the latest model at no extra cost. Would you like us to do that for you?"

Customer: 
"Yes, that would be great. But why did this happen in the first place? How can I make sure it doesn't happen again?"

Agent: 
"We apologize for any confusion on our end. We strive to provide our customers with accurate information about our products and services, and we take full responsibility for any mistakes made on our part. We will investigate this issue further and make sure that it doesn't happen again."

Customer: 
"That's good to hear. But what happens if I don't want to upgrade my phone? Can I still get a refund?"

Agent: 
"Yes, absolutely. We offer a full refund for any product that does not meet your expectations. Please let us know if you would like us to process a refund for you."

Customer: 
"That would be great. Can you also downgrade my service plan? The one I have right now is too expensive and I don't need all these features." 

Agent: 
"Yes, absolutely. We can certainly help you downgrade your service plan so that you only pay for what you need. Please let me know which features you would like to keep and which ones you would like to remove, and we will work out a plan that fits your needs."

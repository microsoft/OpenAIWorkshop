Hello, I'm looking for some information about the Contoso Wireless product phone. Can you help me?

Agent:

Hello, and thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. We're happy to provide you with any information you need about our product phone. How can I help you?

Customer:

I was reading some reviews online and it seems like the phone is having some major issues with battery life. Is this true?

Agent:

Yes, we have had some reports of battery life issues with our product phone. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused and are working diligently to resolve the issue as soon as possible. In the meantime, we have a few tips that may help extend your battery life. Would you like to hear them? 

Customer: 
Yes, please tell me what I can do to extend the battery life. 

Agent: 
Absolutely! Here are a few tips that may help extend your battery life: 
1) Reduce the screen brightness and timeout settings - This will reduce the amount of power your phone uses when not in use. 
2) Turn off background data - This will prevent apps from running in the background and using up unnecessary power. 
3) Uninstall unused apps - Apps that are not being used will still be running in the background and using up power unnecessarily. 
4) Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when not in use - These connections use up extra power when they are on but not actively being used. 
5) Charge your phone regularly - Make sure to charge your phone regularly to keep it at optimal performance levels. 
6) Turn off location services - This will prevent your phone from searching for nearby networks and using up extra power. 
7) Regularly clear out your cache - This will free up space on your device and help improve performance overall. 
8) Avoid high-performance activities - Activities such as gaming or streaming videos will require more power from your device than normal usage.

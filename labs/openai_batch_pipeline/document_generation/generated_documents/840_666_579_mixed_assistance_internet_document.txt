Customer: Hi, I'm having some issues with Contoso Wireless' internet product.

Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that you're having some trouble. How can I help?

Customer: Well, it's been really slow lately and I'm not sure why.

Agent: Alright, let's take a look and see what might be causing the issue. Could you tell me what type of device you are using to access the internet?

Customer: It's a laptop computer.

Agent: Okay, great. Could you please provide me with the model number of your laptop so that I can get a better idea of what we are working with?

Customer: Sure, it's a Dell Inspiron 5555.

Agent: Alright, great. Let's see if we can troubleshoot this issue for you. First, can you confirm that your computer is connected to Contoso Wireless' internet product?

Customer: Yes, it is connected. 

Agent: Okay, great. Let's try running a speed test on your connection and see what kind of results we get. Could you please open a web browser on your laptop and navigate to the speedtest.net website? 

Customer: Sure, no problem. 

Agent: Great, once the page has loaded please click on the ‘Begin Test’ button and let me know when you are done. 

Customer: Alright, I just ran the speed test and the results say my download speed is only 0.5 Mbps and my upload speed is 0.2 Mbps - this is way lower than what I am supposed to be getting with Contoso Wireless' internet product! 

Agent: Hmm, that does seem quite low for the plan you have purchased with us. Let me take a look at your account and see if there is anything I can do to help improve your speeds. Can you please provide me with your account number? 

Customer: Sure, it's 1234567890. 

Agent: Alright, thank you for providing that information. Let me take a look here and see what I can do... Okay, it looks like there was an issue with our network in your area that was causing speeds to drop significantly - this has now been resolved so your speeds should improve dramatically! Can you please run another speed test to confirm this? 

Customer: Absolutely! Just ran another test and my download speed is now up to 30 Mbps and my upload speed is up to 25 Mbps - much better!  Thanks for helping me out here! 

Agent: No problem at all! Glad to hear that everything is now running smoothly for you again. If there's anything else I can help with just let me know - have a great day!

Customer: Hi, I'm looking for some help with my Contoso Wireless billing.

Agent: Hi there, my name is Mike. How can I help you today?

Customer: I just got a new phone from Contoso Wireless and I was wondering if there's anything I need to do in terms of billing?

Agent: Sure, let me look into that for you. Can you tell me what kind of phone you got?

Customer: It's a Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. 

Agent: Got it. Let me take a look at your account and see what we can do. Can I get your account number? 

Customer: Sure, it's 8273746. 

Agent: Great, thank you. Let me just pull up your account information. One moment please...OK, here we are. So it looks like you're on our basic plan which includes unlimited talk and text as well as 2GB of data for $49/month. Is that correct? 

Customer: Yes, that's right. 

Agent: Perfect. Now that you have a new phone, there are a few things we need to do to update your billing information so that it's accurate and up to date. First, I'll need to add the new device to your account which will increase the monthly cost by $10/month due to the phone itself. Second, I'll need to adjust the data plan so that it's sufficient for your new device. We offer 3GB of data for $59/month or 5GB of data for $79/month if you'd like to upgrade. What would you like to do? 

Customer: Can I just stay on the 2GB plan for now? That should be enough for me. 

Agent: Absolutely! That's no problem at all. Let me just make those adjustments for you now and then we can take a look at your updated bill and review any other questions you might have about the device itself or any other related services we offer here at Contoso Wireless. Does that sound ok? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds great!

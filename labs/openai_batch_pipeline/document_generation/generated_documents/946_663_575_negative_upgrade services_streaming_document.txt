Customer: "Sure, my account number is 1234567890."

Agent: "Thank you for providing your account information. Let me take a look at your account and see what I can do to help. Please give me one moment while I review your account."

Customer: "No problem." 

Agent: "I see that you have an older model phone that may not be compatible with our streaming services. Would you be interested in upgrading to a newer model phone that would work better with our streaming services?" 

Customer: "Yes, I think that would be a good idea. What kind of phones do you have available?" 

Agent: "We have a variety of models available. We have the latest iPhones as well as Samsung Galaxy phones. We also have some budget-friendly options available as well. What kind of phone were you looking for?" 

Customer: "I was looking for something mid-range with a good camera. Do you have any recommendations?" 

Agent: "Absolutely! We have several models that would fit your needs. The Samsung Galaxy S10 is a great option with a great camera and mid-range price point. We also have the iPhone 11 Pro which has an amazing camera and a slightly higher price point. Let me know which one you would like to upgrade to and I can help get the process started." 

Customer: "I think I'll go with the Samsung Galaxy S10. How much will it cost to upgrade?" 

Agent: "The Samsung Galaxy S10 is $699 plus taxes and fees, but we do offer financing options if that helps. We also have some promotional offers available right now if you're interested." 

Customer: "That sounds great! What kind of promotional offers do you have?" 

Agent: "We currently have a promotion where if you upgrade today, we'll waive the activation fee and give you free shipping on your new phone. Does that sound like something you're interested in?" 

Customer: "Yes, that sounds great! How do I get started?" 

Agent: "I'm glad to hear that! All you need to do is fill out our online form with your contact information and payment details, and we'll take care of the rest! Once your new phone arrives, we'll help set it up and make sure everything is working properly."

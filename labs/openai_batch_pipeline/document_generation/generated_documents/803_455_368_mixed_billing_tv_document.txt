Customer Service Agent: Hi, welcome to Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, I'm having some problems with my billing. I just got a new TV, and I think it's connected to my account, but I'm not sure. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent: Sure thing! Can you please provide your account number so that I can look into it for you? 

Customer: Sure. My account number is 13234567. 

Customer Service Agent: Thanks for that information. Could you please confirm that the device in question is a television? 

Customer: Yes, it is a TV. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay great. Let me take a look into this for you. Can you please provide me with the make and model of the TV? 

Customer: It's a Samsung 55 inch LED HDTV. 

Customer Service Agent: Got it! It looks like the TV is connected to your account and is currently under a promotion. Are you aware of this promotion? 

Customer: No, I'm not. What kind of promotion is it? 

Customer Service Agent: It looks like you are eligible for a free month of service if you pay for two months upfront. Would you like to take advantage of this promotion? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds great! How do I go about doing that? 

Customer Service Agent: Sure thing! All you have to do is pay for two months upfront and then you will receive a free month of service as part of the promotion. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all I needed help with. Thanks for your help!

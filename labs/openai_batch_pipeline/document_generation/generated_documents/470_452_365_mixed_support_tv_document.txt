Customer: Hi there, I'm having some trouble with my Contoso Wireless TV. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi there! Absolutely, I can help you out with that. What's the issue you're having?

Customer: Well, I was watching something and then the screen went black. I can't get it to turn back on. 

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you please tell me if any lights on your device are illuminated? 

Customer: Yes, the power light is on but nothing else. 

Agent: Okay, let's try a few things. First, please unplug the power cord from the back of the TV and wait 10 seconds before plugging it back in. Then press and hold down the power button for 10 seconds to see if it will power up. 

Customer: Alright, I did that but nothing happened. 

Agent: That's okay. We can still troubleshoot this further. Could you please tell me what type of connection your TV is using? Is it connected to a cable box or a satellite receiver? 

Customer: It's connected to a satellite receiver. 

Agent: Okay, great. In that case, please try resetting your satellite receiver by unplugging it for 10 seconds and then plugging it back in and powering it up again. Once that's done, try powering on your TV again and see if that resolves the issue. 

Customer: Alright, I did that and it worked! Thank you so much for your help! 

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all. Thank you again!

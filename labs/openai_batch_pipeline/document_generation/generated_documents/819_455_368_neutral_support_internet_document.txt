Customer:
Hello, I'm looking for support for a Contoso Wireless product. Can you help me?

Agent:
Good day, and thank you for reaching out to Contoso Wireless. We're here to provide any assistance we can. What specific issue are you having with your Contoso Wireless product?

Customer:
I'm having an issue with my internet connection. It's been slow and unreliable lately.

Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me what type of device you are using to connect to the internet?

Customer: 
I'm using a Contoso Wireless router. 

Agent: 
Thank you for that information. Are there any other devices connected to the router that could be affecting your internet connection? 

Customer: 
Yes, I have two laptops and two smartphones connected to the router. 

Agent: 
I see. Have you tried disconnecting the other devices and seeing if that improves your connection? 

Customer: 
No, I haven't tried that yet. Do you think it would help? 

Agent: 
It is possible that one of the other devices is causing interference with your internet connection, so it may be worth a try. Before we try that though, let's run a few tests on the router itself to make sure there aren't any issues with the hardware or settings. Can you access the router's settings page? 

Customer: 
Yes, I can access the settings page. 

Agent: 
Excellent. Could you please run a speed test from the router settings page and let me know what speeds you are getting? That will give us an indication of whether there is an issue with your router or not.

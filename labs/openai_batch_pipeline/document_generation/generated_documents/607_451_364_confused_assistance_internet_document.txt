Customer Service Agent:

Welcome to Contoso Wireless, how can I help you today? 

Customer:

Hi, I'm looking for some help with the internet service you provide. 

Customer Service Agent:

Sure, what kind of help do you need? 

Customer:
I'm having trouble connecting to the internet. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps but nothing has worked. 

Customer Service Agent:
I understand your frustration. Can you tell me what device you are using to access the internet? 

Customer: 
I'm using a laptop with Windows 10 installed. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Ok, can you please open your web browser and check if the connection is stable? 

Customer: 
Yes, I have done that but it's still not working. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I see. Is there anything else that you have done to try and solve this issue? 

Customer: 
Yes, I have tried restarting my laptop and resetting the network settings but nothing has worked so far. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Ok, I think we should try something else then. Can you please check if your router is connected to your modem correctly? If not, please disconnect it and then reconnect it again and see if that helps. 

Customer: 
Yes, I have already done that but it still isn't working. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Ok, let me take a look at your account and see if there are any issues that might be causing this problem. Can you please provide me with your account information?  

 Customer:  Sure, here is my account information.

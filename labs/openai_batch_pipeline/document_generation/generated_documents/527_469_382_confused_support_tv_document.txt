Welcome to Contoso Wireless! How may I help you today?

Customer: 
Hi, I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless TV and I'm having some trouble setting it up. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent: 
Sure thing! What kind of issue are you having with your TV?

Customer: 
Well, I can't seem to get the picture to come in clearly. It's all fuzzy and distorted.

Customer Service Agent: 
I see. Can you tell me what kind of connections you're using to connect the TV? Are you using an HDMI cable or another type of connection?

Customer: 
Yes, I'm using an HDMI cable. Is that the problem?

Customer Service Agent: 
It could be. Can you try connecting the TV to another device such as a laptop or gaming console and see if the picture is clearer? 

Customer: 
I did that and it still looks fuzzy. Is there something else I should try? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, try adjusting the display settings on the TV itself. Try different resolutions and see if that helps improve the picture quality. You can also try resetting the TV to factory settings and see if that helps. 

Customer: 
Okay, I'll give that a try. Is there anything else I should be aware of when it comes to setting up my Contoso Wireless TV? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, make sure to update your TV's software regularly to ensure that all features are working properly and that you have access to the latest content available.

Customer:
Hello, I recently purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and I am having some problems with it. The phone keeps freezing and the battery is draining quickly. I'm not sure what to do, can you help?

Agent:
Hello, and thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. We apologize for the inconvenience you are experiencing with your phone. We understand how frustrating this can be, and we would be more than happy to help you resolve the issue. Can you please provide us with some more information so that we can better assist you?

Customer:
Sure, the model of my phone is the Contoso G6. I've had it for about two weeks now, and it has been freezing quite frequently. It's also been draining battery really quickly, even when I'm not using it.

Agent:
I apologize for the issues you have been experiencing with your Contoso G6. Please allow me to investigate this further and try to identify what may be causing this issue. In order to do so, could you please provide us with your phone's serial number?

Customer:
Yes, of course. The serial number is XXXXXXXXXXX. 

Agent:
Thank you for providing us with your serial number. We will now be able to investigate this further and try to identify what may be causing these issues. In the meantime, please try to keep your phone in an area with good signal strength, as this can help prevent it from freezing or draining battery too quickly. 

Customer: 
Okay, I'll try that. But what else can I do? Is there anything else that Contoso Wireless can do to help me resolve this issue? 

Agent: 
We certainly understand your frustration and want to help you as best as we can. We recommend that you perform a hard reset on your phone as this may help resolve any software related issues that may be causing these problems. To perform a hard reset, simply press and hold the power button and volume down button simultaneously until the phone vibrates three times and then turns off. Once it turns back on again, check to see if the issue persists. 

Customer: 
Okay, I'll give that a try. But if that doesn't work, what are my other options? 

Agent: 
If performing a hard reset does not resolve the issue then we recommend that you contact our technical support team directly so that they can provide further assistance. Our technical support team is available 24/7 and they can be reached by calling 1-800-123-4567 or by sending an email to support@contosowireless.com . They will be more than happy to answer any questions or concerns that you may have about your device. 

Customer: 
Alright, thank you for all your help so far. I'll contact the technical support team if the hard reset doesn't work out for me. 

Agent: 
You're welcome! If there is anything else we can do for you please don't hesitate to reach out again and we will be more than happy to assist you in any way we can. Have a great day!

Customer:
"I'm really unhappy with the service I'm getting from Contoso Wireless. I recently had to downgrade my internet services and it's been nothing but a hassle. The speeds are so slow, I can't even stream Netflix without it buffering every few minutes. This is unacceptable!"

Agent:
"I'm sorry to hear that you're having issues with your internet service. Let's see if we can get this resolved for you. Can you tell me what kind of internet plan you have?"

Customer:
"I used to have the 50 mbps plan, but I had to downgrade to the 10 mbps plan due to financial constraints. It's just not cutting it for me."

Agent:
"I understand. Unfortunately, when you downgrade your internet plan, you're going to experience slower speeds. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I'd like to know what other options I have for faster internet without breaking the bank. Is there anything else available at a lower price point?"

Agent: 
"Yes, we do have other options available at different price points. We offer a 25 mbps plan for $50/month, and a 50 mbps plan for $75/month. Both of these plans come with unlimited data."

Customer: 
"That sounds great! Can I upgrade my plan right away or do I need to wait until my current plan expires?" 

Agent: 
"You can upgrade your plan right away, but please keep in mind that your current plan will still be in effect until it expires. If you decide to upgrade now, you'll be billed for both plans until your current one expires." 

Customer: 
"Okay, that makes sense. How soon will the upgrade take effect? Will I be able to start using the higher speeds right away?" 

Agent: 
"Yes, once you upgrade your plan, you'll be able to start using the higher speeds right away. You won't have to wait for any additional activation period or anything like that." 

Customer: 
"Great! That's really helpful. Can you walk me through the process of upgrading my plan? I want to make sure I do it correctly." 

Agent: 
"Sure! All you need to do is log into your account on our website and select the plan that you want to upgrade to. Once you've selected it, just follow the prompts on the screen and you'll be all set!"

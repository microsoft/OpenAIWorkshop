Customer Service Agent: Hi, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. How may I help you?

Customer: Hi, I'm having some issues with my phone. I recently upgraded to the latest model and it's been nothing but problems since then.

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. What kind of issues have you been experiencing?

Customer: Well, for starters the battery life is really bad. It drains really quickly even when I'm not using it. Also, the screen keeps freezing and crashing. It's really frustrating.

Customer Service Agent: I understand how frustrating that can be. Is there anything else you've noticed?

Customer: Yes, I think it's also randomly restarting itself. It's like it just shuts off and then turns back on again without me doing anything. It's really annoying. 

Customer Service Agent: That certainly doesn't sound good. Let me see what I can do to help you out with this issue. Can you please provide me with your account information so that I can take a closer look?

Customer: Sure, here it is [provides account information]. 

Customer Service Agent: Thanks for providing that information. Please give me a few moments while I take a look at your account and see what we can do about your phone issue. 

Customer: Alright, thank you. 

Customer Service Agent: No problem at all. After taking a look at your account, I see that we can provide you with a replacement phone free of charge as part of our upgrade services policy. Would you like to take advantage of this offer? 

Customer: Yes, absolutely! That would be great! 

Customer Service Agent: Great! All we need to do is send you a replacement phone and arrange for someone to pick up the faulty one from your address. Is that okay? 

Customer: Yes, that's perfect! Thank you so much for all your help!

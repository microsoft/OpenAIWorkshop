Customer: Hi, I'm looking for some assistance with my new phone.

Agent: Hi, I'm here to help. What seems to be the problem?

Customer: I just bought this phone yesterday and I can't seem to get it to work. It won't turn on or charge.

Agent: I understand that this can be frustrating. Is this the first time you have used a Contoso Wireless phone?

Customer: Yes, it is. 

Agent: Alright, let's take a look and see what the issue might be. First, let's make sure the phone is properly charged. Can you try plugging it into the wall outlet for at least an hour? 

Customer: Yes, I can do that. 

Agent: Great! While you're doing that, I'll also need to ask a few questions about your device and setup process. How did you set up your device when you first got it? 

Customer: I followed the instructions in the manual and connected to the wifi network. Then I entered my login information and accepted all of the terms and conditions. 

Agent: Okay, that sounds like everything should have been set up correctly then. After you plugged in your phone, did you try turning it on? 

Customer: Yes, but nothing happened when I pressed the power button. 

Agent: Alright, let's take a look at some of the other possible causes then. Can you try pressing and holding the power button for at least 10 seconds? This should force a restart on your device if it isn't responding to the regular power button press. 

Customer: Okay, I'll give that a try. 

Agent: Great! Let me know if that doesn't work and we can look into other possibilities such as hardware issues or a software issue with your device.

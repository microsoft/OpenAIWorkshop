Agent: Hi there! We have a wide selection of phones here at Contoso Wireless. What type of phone are you looking for? 

Customer: I'm looking for a smartphone that can handle a lot of data and be able to do video calls.

Customer: Yes, that sounds great! What kind of payment options do you offer?

Agent: We offer several payment options here at Contoso Wireless. You can pay in full upfront with a credit card, or you can choose to spread your payments over 6, 12, or 24 months with no interest if paid in full.

Customer: That sounds great! Is there any additional information I need to know about the payment process? 

Agent: Absolutely! All of our payment plans require an initial down payment of 10% of the purchase price before taxes and fees. You'll also need to submit proof of identity and a valid credit or debit card. Once we have those details, we'll be able to process your order. 

Customer: Perfect, that all sounds very straightforward. Do you have any additional information about the phone itself? 

Agent: Absolutely! The Contoso X500 is one of our most popular phones due to its powerful specs and intuitive design.

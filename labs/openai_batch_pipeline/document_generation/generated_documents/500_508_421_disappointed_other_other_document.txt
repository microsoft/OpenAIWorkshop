Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a product from Contoso Wireless and I am disappointed. I was told that it had certain features that it doesn't have.

Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you are unhappy with your purchase. Could you tell me more about what features you were expecting?

Customer: I was told that this product would have the ability to connect to other devices and perform various tasks. But it doesn't seem to do that at all.

Agent: I see. Let me take a look at your purchase and see if there is something we can do. Can you provide me with the product information so that I can look into this further?

Customer: Sure, here is the product code: XXXXXX.

Agent: Thanks for providing the product code. I'm going to take a look and see what I can find out for you. In the meantime, can you tell me a bit more about what you were expecting the product to do?

Customer: Well, I was expecting it to be able to connect with other devices and perform tasks such as file transfers, video conferencing, etc. But it doesn't seem to be able to do any of that.

Agent: Alright, thank you for providing more information. Let me take a look at this and see if there is something we can do for you. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns?

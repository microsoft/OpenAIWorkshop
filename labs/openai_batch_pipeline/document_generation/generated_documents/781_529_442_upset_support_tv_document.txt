Customer: Hi, I just bought a Contoso Wireless TV and it doesn't seem to be working.

Agent: Hello, I apologize for the inconvenience. How can I help you today?

Customer: Well, I'm having trouble getting it set up. It's been hours and I can't seem to get it to work.

Agent: I understand. What kind of issues are you having specifically?

Customer: The remote won't turn the TV on and the setup menu won't appear on the screen. 

Agent: OK, let's see what we can do here. First, can you make sure that the power cord is securely plugged into the wall outlet and that the TV is switched on?

Customer: Yes, I've checked that already and it's all plugged in correctly. 

Agent: All right, let's move on then. Can you try to press and hold down the power button on the side of the TV for 10 seconds? That should reset the device. 

Customer: OK, I'll give it a try. 

Agent: Great, please let me know if that works. 

Customer: It didn't work. 

Agent: Alright, no problem. Have you tried using a different remote? It might be that the remote isn't properly connected with the TV or is not compatible with our product. 

Customer: Yes, I've tried another remote and it still didn't work. 

Agent: OK then, have you tried performing a factory reset? That should restore your device to its original settings and hopefully fix any software issues that you may be experiencing. 

Customer: No, I haven't done a factory reset yet. How do I do that? 

Agent: Sure, let me walk you through it. First, make sure that your TV is powered off and then press and hold down both the power button and the volume button at the same time for 10 seconds until you hear two short beeps. That should initiate the factory reset process and once completed your TV should be restored to its original settings.

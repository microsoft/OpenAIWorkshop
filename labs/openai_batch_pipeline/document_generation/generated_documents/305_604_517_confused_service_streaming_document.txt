 Agent: Okay, I've taken a closer look at your account and it appears that there may be an issue with your subscription status. Are you currently subscribed to the streaming service? 

 Customer: Yes, I am subscribed. 

 Agent: Okay great! It looks like the subscription status is not reflecting properly in our system. To resolve this issue, I'll need to reset your subscription status manually and then the streaming service should work properly for you. Is that okay? 

 Customer: Yes, that sounds good. How long will it take for the reset to be complete? 

 Agent: The reset should be completed within the next 10-15 minutes and then you should be able to access the streaming service without any issues. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

 Customer: No, that should be all for now. Thanks for your help!

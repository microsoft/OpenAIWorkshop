Customer Service Agent: Welcome to Contoso Wireless customer service, my name is [Name]. How can I help you?

Customer: Hi, I've been having trouble with my internet lately and it's really starting to become an issue.

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me more about the issue you are having? 

Customer: Sure, for the past week or so my internet has been dropping out randomly and it's really impacting my work. I'm starting to get really frustrated. 

Customer Service Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me look into this for you. Could you please confirm your billing information so I can access your account? 

Customer: Yes, my name is [Name], and my account number is [number]. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for that information. It looks like your account is in arrears. We need to bring your balance up to date before we can investigate the issue with your internet. 

Customer: That's ridiculous! Why didn't anyone tell me this earlier? 

Customer Service Agent: We usually send out reminders a few days before the due date, but unfortunately sometimes they can be missed. Is there any way we can resolve this so we can look into the issue with your internet? 

Customer: Well, what kind of payment options do you have? 

Customer Service Agent: We accept payments via credit card, debit card, check, or money order. 

Customer: Okay, I'll make a payment via credit card. Can you tell me how much I owe? 

Customer Service Agent: Sure, your current balance is $[amount]. Is there anything else I can help you with?

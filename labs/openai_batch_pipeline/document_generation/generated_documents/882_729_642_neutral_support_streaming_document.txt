Customer: Hi, I'm having some trouble streaming on my Contoso Wireless device. Can you help me?

Agent: Hello, and thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless! I'd be happy to help you with your streaming issues. Can you tell me a bit more about what's happening?

Customer: Sure. When I try to stream something, the video or audio is choppy and I can't seem to get it to run smoothly. 

Agent: Alright, that's definitely an issue that can be fixed. Before we begin troubleshooting, can you tell me if you're using any additional apps while streaming? 

Customer: No, I'm not using any other apps while streaming. 

Agent: Okay, great. Let's go ahead and try a few things to see if we can get the streaming running smoothly again. First, let's try restarting your Contoso Wireless device by pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds. 

Customer: Okay, I've done that. 

Agent: Great! Now, let's check your connection speed to make sure it's fast enough to support streaming. Please check the speed test results on your device and let me know what it says. 

Customer: It looks like my connection speed is around 5 Mbps, which should be fast enough for streaming. 

Agent: That's good news! In that case, let's try resetting your network settings to see if that helps with the streaming issue. To do this, go to your settings menu and tap on 'Reset Network Settings.' Once it's done resetting, test the streaming again and let me know if it works better. 

Customer: Alright, I've done that too but it didn't seem to make a difference. 

Agent: Hmm...okay then, let's move on to the next step in our troubleshooting process. Have you tried streaming from a different app or service? This will help us narrow down where the problem might be coming from. 

Customer: Yes, I've tried streaming from multiple apps and services but still no luck. 

Agent: Alright then, let's try clearing the app cache of all of the apps you're trying to stream from. This will help make sure that there isn't any outdated information causing problems with the streaming performance. To do this, go into each app's settings menu and tap 'Clear Cache.' Then test out the streaming again and let me know how it goes. 

Customer: Okay, I've done that too but still no luck. 

Agent: Alright then, unfortunately it looks like we've exhausted all of our troubleshooting options at this point. We'll have to take a deeper look into this issue so we can figure out why the streaming isn't working properly on your Contoso Wireless device. Could you please provide us with more details about your device and what steps you've already taken so far? This will help us get a better idea of what might be going wrong here and how we can fix it for you as quickly as possible.

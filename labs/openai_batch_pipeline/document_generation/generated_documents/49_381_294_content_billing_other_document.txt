Customer Service Agent:

Hello and welcome to Contoso Wireless! How can I help you today?

Customer:

Hi there. I'm having a billing issue and I'm hoping you can help. 

Customer Service Agent:

I'll be happy to help. What is the issue with your billing?

Customer:

Well, I received my bill this month and it's higher than normal. I'm wondering if there's something wrong with my account or if I was charged for something I didn't order. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I understand your concern. Let me take a look at your account to see what's going on. Can you tell me the amount of the bill? 

Customer: 

Sure, it's $125. 

Customer Service Agent: 

OK, let me take a look at your account. It looks like you were charged for a new phone upgrade that you ordered last week. Is that correct? 

Customer: 
Yes, that's right. But I thought the upgrade was free with my current plan? 

 Customer Service Agent: 

 That's correct - the upgrade is free with your current plan. However, there was an additional fee for shipping the phone to you. That's why your bill is higher than normal this month. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

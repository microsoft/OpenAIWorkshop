Customer: Hi, I'm having a lot of trouble with the Contoso Wireless TV I bought.

Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your Contoso Wireless TV. How can I help you?

Customer: Well, I just set it up and it won't connect to the internet. It's been like this for hours now and nothing I do seems to work.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's see if we can get your Contoso Wireless TV connected to the internet. What type of internet connection are you using? 

Customer: Wi-Fi.

Agent: Great. Can you please check if your modem is properly connected to your Contoso Wireless TV? 

Customer: Yeah, it looks like it's connected properly. 

Agent: Okay. Can you please try resetting your modem by unplugging it for about 30 seconds and then plugging it back in? 

Customer: Okay, I'll give that a try. 

Agent: Great. While you're doing that, can you tell me what type of router you have? 

Customer: It's an ASUS RT-AC68U Dual-Band Wireless Router. 

Agent: Alright, let's see if resetting the router helps. Can you confirm that after you reset the router, your Contoso Wireless TV is still not connecting to the internet? 

Customer: Yes, unfortunately it still isn't connecting after resetting the router. 

Agent: Alright, let's see if we can get this sorted out. Is your modem connected directly to your Contoso Wireless TV or is there another device in between them? 

Customer: There is a switch between them. 

Agent: Okay great, let's try resetting the switch as well by unplugging it for 30 seconds and then plugging it back in. Does this help get your Contoso Wireless TV connected to the internet? 

Customer: Yes! That did the trick! Thank you so much for all your help!

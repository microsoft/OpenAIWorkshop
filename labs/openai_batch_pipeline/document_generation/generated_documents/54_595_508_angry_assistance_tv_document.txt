Customer:
Hello, I'm calling because I recently purchased a TV from your company Contoso Wireless and I'm having some trouble with it. I've been trying to get help for hours now and I'm really getting frustrated. 

Agent:
Hello there, I apologize for any inconvenience you may be experiencing. How can I help you with your TV?

Customer:
Well, it won't turn on. I've tried plugging it in and out multiple times, but nothing is happening. It's really frustrating because I just bought this TV and now it's not working. 

Agent:
I understand your frustration. Let me see what I can do to help you. Can you tell me what type of TV did you purchase? 

Customer:
Yes, it's a Contoso Wireless 32 inch LED Smart TV. 

Agent:
Okay, thank you for the information. Can you please tell me if the power light is on when you plug it in? 

Customer:
Yes, the power light is on but nothing else happens when I try to turn it on. 

Agent:
Alright, we'll try a few things to see if we can get your TV working again. First, let's try unplugging the power cable from the back of the TV and plugging it back in after 10 seconds. Can you please try that for me? 

Customer:
Yes, I did that but nothing happened. 

Agent:
Okay, no problem. Let's try resetting the TV by pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds then releasing it and turning it back on again. Can you please try that? 

Customer:
Yes, I just did that but still nothing is happening. 

Agent:
Alright, no problem. We'll try one last thing before we look into other options. Please unplug the power cable again then press and hold the power button for 30 seconds before plugging it back in and turning it on again. Does that sound okay? 

Customer: 
Yes, that sounds okay but I'm really getting frustrated here. This shouldn't be this difficult to get my new TV working! 

 Agent: 
I understand your frustration and I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We will do our best to get your TV working as soon as possible. Can you please try the last step that we discussed?

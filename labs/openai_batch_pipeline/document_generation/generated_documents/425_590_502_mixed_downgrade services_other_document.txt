Customer: Hi, I'm interested in downgrading my services with Contoso Wireless. I'm hoping you can help me understand my options.

Agent: Hi there! I'm happy to help you with that. Would you like to discuss your current plan and what options you have for downgrading? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great. Can you tell me what the current plan is?

Agent: Sure! You currently have the Contoso Wireless Ultimate Plan which includes unlimited data, text and voice, international roaming and tethering for $99 per month.

Customer: Okay, so what options do I have for downgrading?

Agent: You have a few options. You can downgrade to our Contoso Wireless Basic Plan which includes 5GB of data, unlimited text and voice and international roaming for $59 per month. You can also downgrade to our Contoso Wireless Lite Plan which includes 2GB of data, unlimited text and voice and no international roaming for $39 per month. 

Customer: Are there any other options besides these two? 

Agent: Yes! You also have the option of our Contoso Wireless Economy Plan which includes 1GB of data, unlimited text and voice and no international roaming for $19 per month. 

Customer: That's helpful, thank you. Is there any other way I can save money on my plan? 

Agent: Yes! We also offer discounts on certain plans when you sign up for a longer contract. For example, if you sign up for the Contoso Wireless Ultimate Plan for 24 months, you'll get an additional 10% discount each month for the duration of your contract. 

Customer: That sounds good! Can I keep my current phone number if I downgrade my plan? 

Agent: Absolutely! Your phone number is tied to your account so it will remain the same regardless of what plan you choose. 

Customer: Great, that's really helpful. Is there anything else I should know before I make my decision? 

Agent: Just one more thing - once you downgrade your plan, it cannot be changed back to the original plan until after your contract ends or if you decide to pay an early termination fee. So make sure that you're completely happy with your decision before moving forward. 

Customer: Got it. Thanks for all the information - I think I have enough to make an informed decision now.

Customer: 
"Hello, I recently purchased a phone from your company and I'm having a lot of trouble with it. Can you help me?"

Agent: 
"Hello! We are so sorry to hear that you are having difficulties with your phone. We will do our best to help you out. Can you tell me what kind of phone you have and what the issue is?"

Customer: 
"I have a Contoso Wireless phone. The problem is that it keeps freezing and shutting down on its own. It's been really frustrating."

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. We take great pride in our products and we want to make sure that they are functioning correctly. Can you tell me if this problem has occurred while you were using the phone or while it was sitting idle?"

Customer: 
"It happens randomly, but mostly when I'm using it. It's really annoying because I can't get anything done without it shutting down."

Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating this can be. Let me look into this further and see what might be causing the issue. In the meantime, can you tell me if there is anything else that we can do to help you?"

Customer: 
"Well, I guess I'd like to know if there is any way to fix the issue so I don't have to keep dealing with it. Is there a warranty or something?"

Agent: 
"Yes, absolutely! We offer a one year warranty on all of our products, so if there is an issue within the first year of use we will be happy to repair or replace your phone at no cost to you. Would you like us to help you set up a service call?"

Customer: 
"That would be great! Can I get a replacement right away or do I have to wait for repairs?"

Agent: 
"We can certainly provide you with a replacement right away if that is what you prefer. We just need to go through some paperwork and verify your purchase information before we can process the request."

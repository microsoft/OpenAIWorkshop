Customer:

Hello, I recently purchased a product from Contoso Wireless and I'm not happy with it. It doesn't seem to be working as advertised. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent: 

Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're unhappy with your product. What kind of product did you purchase from us?

Customer: 

I purchased the Other device, but it's not working properly. I was hoping to get some help with this issue. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please tell me more about what is happening with the device? 

Customer: 

Well, when I turn it on, the screen just stays black and nothing happens. I've tried turning it off and on again multiple times but nothing changes. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I understand. Could you please tell me what troubleshooting steps have you already tried? 

Customer: 

Yes, I've tried restarting it multiple times and also checked if all the cables are connected properly. But nothing seems to work. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I see. Have you tried performing a factory reset on the device? This should reset any settings that may have been causing an issue. 

 Customer: 
Yes, I did try that but it still doesn't work. Is there anything else I can do?

 Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, we recommend that you contact our technical support team for further assistance with this issue. They will be able to provide more in-depth troubleshooting steps that may help resolve the issue.

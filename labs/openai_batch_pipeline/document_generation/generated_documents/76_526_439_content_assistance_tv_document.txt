Customer: Hi, I'm looking for help with the product TV I purchased from Contoso Wireless.

Agent: Hi there! My name is [Name], and I'm one of the customer service agents at Contoso Wireless. How can I help you?

Customer: I received the product TV but it doesn't seem to be working correctly. The screen won't turn on.

Agent: I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. Let's see what we can do to get it working again. Can you tell me a bit more about what's happening with the TV? 

Customer: When I plug it in and try to turn it on, nothing happens. The screen remains black.

Agent: Alright, let's go through a few steps to see if we can get this sorted out for you. First, let's check the power cord and make sure that it is securely connected to both the outlet and the TV. 

Customer: It is connected correctly, but nothing is happening when I try to turn it on. 

Agent: Okay, let's try unplugging it from the outlet and then plugging it back in. After that, press and hold down the power button for 10 seconds. Does anything happen after that? 

Customer: Still nothing. 

Agent: Alright, let's try a few more steps then. Could you please open up the back panel of the TV and make sure that all of the connections are securely attached? 

Customer: Yes, everything looks connected properly. 

Agent: Great! Now, let's reset the TV by pressing and holding down both the power button and the volume button for 10 seconds at the same time. Does anything happen after that? 

Customer: Wow, that did it! The screen just turned on! Thank you so much for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! I'm glad we were able to get your TV up and running again. Is there anything else I can do for you today? 

Customer: No, that should be all. Thanks again!

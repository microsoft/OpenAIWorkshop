Agent: Great, thank you for that information. Can you tell me what kind of billing issue you're having?

Customer: Well, I've been noticing some discrepancies in my monthly bill and I'm not sure why. It looks like I'm being charged for more data than what I've actually used. 

Agent: That doesn't sound right. Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on. Can you provide me with your account number? 

Customer: Sure, it's [account number]. 

Agent: Thank you for providing me with that information. I'm just going to take a few moments to review your account and see what's going on here.

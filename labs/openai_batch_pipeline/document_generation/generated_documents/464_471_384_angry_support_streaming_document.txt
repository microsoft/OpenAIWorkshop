Customer: 
"I'm so angry right now. I recently bought the Contoso Wireless streaming product and I can't get it to work properly. I've spent hours trying to get it to work but nothing I do seems to help. This is ridiculous!"

Customer Service Agent: 
"I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with our streaming product. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue? We'll try to get it sorted out as soon as possible."

Customer: 
"It just won't connect! It keeps giving me error messages no matter what I try. I've tried restarting my device, restarting the router, changing the settings, but nothing has worked."

Customer Service Agent: 
"I see. Let's try some troubleshooting steps together. Can you please confirm your device is connected to the internet?"

Customer: 
"Yes, my device is connected to the internet."

Customer Service Agent: 
"Alright, can you please check if your streaming product is updated to the latest version? You can do this by going into the settings and checking for any updates."

Customer: 
"Yes, I have checked and there are no updates available."

Customer Service Agent: 
"Okay. The next step would be to reset your streaming product. This will delete all your data but should help resolve any connection issues you may be having. Can you please do that and then let me know how it goes?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, I'll do that now. But this had better work or else I'm never buying anything from Contoso Wireless again!" 

Customer Service Agent: 
"I understand your frustration. Please let me know once you've reset your streaming product so we can see if that resolves the issue."

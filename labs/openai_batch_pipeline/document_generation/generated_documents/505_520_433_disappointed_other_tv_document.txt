Customer Service Agent: Hi there! Thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today? 

Customer: Hi, I recently bought a Contoso Wireless TV and it's been having some problems. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for any issues you are experiencing. What seems to be the problem with your TV? 

Customer: Well, it keeps turning off randomly and the picture quality is terrible. It's definitely not what I expected from Contoso Wireless. 

Customer Service Agent: That doesn't sound good. I'm sorry to hear that your experience hasn't been up to our usual standards. Could you please provide me with the serial number on the back of your TV? 

Customer: Sure, it's SN2345678910. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for providing that information. I am going to check our database and see what we can do for you. Can you please give me a few moments while I look into this? 

Customer: Sure, take your time. 

Customer Service Agent: Great, thank you. After reviewing our records, it looks like your TV is still under warranty, so we can offer you a free replacement if needed. Is there anything else I can do for you today? 

Customer: Actually, yes. Could you explain why this happened in the first place? It seems like a major defect in the product, and I'm not sure if I want to replace it with the same model if this issue could happen again. 

Customer Service Agent: Of course. We take product quality very seriously here at Contoso Wireless, so we appreciate your concern. After doing some research on this particular model of TV, we've found that it has an issue with overheating in certain conditions which can cause it to turn off unexpectedly and also affect picture quality. We are currently working on a fix for this problem which should be released soon, but until then replacing the unit is the best option for resolving this issue for now. Is there anything else I can do for you today?

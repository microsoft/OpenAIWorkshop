Customer: 
"I'm trying to figure out why I'm being charged for the Contoso Wireless product I purchased last week. It's a tv. Can you help me?"

Agent:
"Hello there, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your payment. Can you tell me what product you purchased?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I purchased a Contoso Wireless TV last week."

Agent: 
"That's great! Did you receive any confirmation emails regarding the purchase?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I did. But when I look at my bank statement, it shows that I've been charged twice for the same item."

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take a look into this for you and see what might be causing this issue. Can you provide me with the order number?"

Customer: 
"Yes, here it is: #123456." 

Agent: 
"Thank you for providing that information. Let me take a few moments to investigate this further and see what might be causing the double charge. In the meantime, can you tell me if you received any other emails regarding your purchase?" 

Customer: 
"No, I didn't get any other emails. Just the confirmation one." 

Agent: 
"Okay, thank you for the information. Give me a few minutes to look into this and I'll get back to you with an update as soon as possible." 

 Customer: 
"Okay, thank you." 

 Agent: 
"You're welcome! I'll be right back with an update shortly."

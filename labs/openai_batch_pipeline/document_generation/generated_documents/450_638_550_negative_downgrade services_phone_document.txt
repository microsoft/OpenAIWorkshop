Customer: Hi, I’m having an issue with the phone I bought from Contoso Wireless.

Agent: Hi there, how can I help?

Customer: I’ve been using the phone for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to lag. It’s very slow and unresponsive.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience this is causing you. What model of phone did you purchase? 

Customer: It’s a Contoso Wireless model XC-90.

Agent: Alright, let me check on that for you. Can you tell me more about the issue you’re having? 

Customer: Sure, it’s taking a long time to open apps, send messages and make calls. The screen is also freezing up frequently. 

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at this and see if I can help. Is there anything else you would like to mention? 

Customer: Yes, the battery life is not what it was when I first purchased the phone. It seems to be draining faster than before and I have to charge it more often than usual. 

Agent: Okay, that could be caused by a few different things. Can you tell me if you have been downloading any new apps or updating any of your current ones? 

Customer: Yes, I have been downloading some new apps but they are all from trusted sources so I don't think that's the issue. 

Agent: That's understandable. Are there any other changes that you've noticed since you started using the phone? 

Customer: Well, I recently downgraded my service plan with Contoso Wireless and since then my phone has been really slow and unresponsive. 

Agent: That could be a possible cause for your issue then. Did you make any other changes around the same time as when you downgraded your service plan? 

Customer: No, just the downgrade of my service plan is all that I changed. 

Agent: Alright, let me take a look at this further and see what we can do to help get your phone back up to speed again. In the meantime, have you tried restarting your phone? This may help resolve some of the lag issues that you're experiencing. 

Customer: Yes, I've restarted it several times already but nothing seems to be helping so far. 

Agent: That's understandable - we'll do our best to get this sorted out for you as quickly as possible! In the meantime, is there anything else that I can do for you today?

Customer: Hi, I'm really angry right now and I need some help.

Customer Service Agent: Hello there, I apologize for your frustration. How can I help you?

Customer: I bought a Contoso Wireless product two weeks ago and it's not working correctly. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please provide me with some more information? What type of product did you purchase? 

Customer: It's the Contoso Wireless Other product. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, thank you for providing me with that information. Have you already attempted to troubleshoot the product? 

Customer: Yes, I've tried everything! I've followed all the instructions in the manual, and nothing seems to work. 

Customer Service Agent: I understand your frustration. Can you please provide me with a detailed description of what is happening with the product? 

Customer: Sure. Basically, when I turn it on, the screen stays black and nothing happens. No matter what I do, it won't turn on. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, thank you for providing me with that information. Have you attempted to reset the product by pressing and holding down the power button for 10 seconds? 

Customer: Yes, I've done that multiple times but it still won't turn on. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. We will be more than happy to assist you further with this issue. Please provide me with your order number so that we can proceed with providing a replacement product if necessary.

Hello, I'm having a problem with your service. I've been using Contoso Wireless for a while now, and I'm really frustrated. I'm having issues with my phone, and the product isn't working as it should. Can you help me out?

Agent:

Good afternoon, and thank you for reaching out to Contoso Wireless. I apologize for the inconvenience and would be happy to assist you in resolving this issue. Could you tell me more about what's going on with your phone?

Customer: 
Yes, my phone keeps freezing up and is extremely slow. Also, I'm unable to access some apps and the internet connection is very slow. I've tried restarting it several times but that doesn't seem to help. 

Agent: 
I understand your frustration. Let's try to get this resolved right away. Can you please confirm if you are using a Contoso Wireless device? 

Customer: 
Yes, I am using a Contoso Wireless device. It's the latest model released this year. 

Agent: 
That's great! Could you please provide me with the serial number of your device so that I can run some diagnostics tests? 

Customer: 
Sure, the serial number is 1234-5678-9012-3456. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing me with the serial number. I will now run some diagnostic tests on your device to determine the root cause of the issue. Please bear with me for a few minutes while these tests are being conducted. 

Customer: 
Ok, thank you. 

 Agent: 
The diagnostic tests have been completed and it appears that there is an issue with the software on your device which is causing it to freeze up and be slow. To resolve this issue, we need to update the software on your device. Can you please confirm if you are connected to a Wi-Fi network? 

 Customer: 
Yes, I am connected to a Wi-Fi network. How long will this update take?

 Agent: 
The update should take approximately 10 minutes depending on your internet connection speed. Once the update is complete, your device should be working properly again and all of the issues should be resolved. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Hi, I recently purchased a new phone from Contoso Wireless and I'm having trouble connecting to the internet. Can you help me?

Agent:
Hello! I am happy to help. What type of phone did you purchase? 

Customer:
I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. 

Agent:
Great! Let's start by making sure that your device is set up correctly. Is your device connected to the Contoso Wireless network? 

Customer:
Yes, it is connected to the Contoso Wireless network. 

Agent:
Wonderful! Now, let's make sure that your phone is connected to the internet. Are you able to access the internet on your phone? 

Customer:
No, I am not able to access the internet. When I try to open a web page, it says "No Internet Connection." 

Agent: 
Okay, let's troubleshoot this issue together. First, let's check your data connection. Is your data connection enabled? 

Customer: 
Yes, my data connection is enabled. 

Agent: 
Excellent! Now, let's try restarting your phone and see if that helps with the connection issue. Can you please try restarting your device and then trying again? 

Customer: 
Sure, I'll give it a try. 

Agent: 
Great! Please let me know if you're still having trouble connecting after restarting your device.

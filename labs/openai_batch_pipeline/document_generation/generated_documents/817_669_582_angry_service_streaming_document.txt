Customer:

Good morning, I'm calling about your streaming service. It's been terrible lately and I'm getting very frustrated. I've been a customer for years and I feel like I'm not getting the quality of service that I should be. 

Customer Service Agent:

Good morning, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. I apologize for the issues you are experiencing with our streaming service. How can I help? 

Customer:

I'm having a lot of trouble with buffering, slow speeds, and overall poor quality of the stream. It's been like this for weeks now and it's really starting to impact my experience. 

Customer Service Agent:

I understand your frustration. We take customer satisfaction very seriously here at Contoso Wireless, so let me see what I can do to help resolve this issue. Could you please provide me with some more information about the problem you are having? 

Customer:

Yes, it's been happening across multiple devices and multiple networks. The buffering is especially bad, and sometimes it takes so long for the video to load that it's not even worth trying to watch it. It's been like this ever since the new update that was released a few weeks ago. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. We are aware of the recent update and we have received reports from other customers about similar issues. We are working on addressing these issues as quickly as possible to ensure our customers receive a better streaming experience. In the meantime, would you like me to provide any troubleshooting steps that may help improve your streaming quality? 

Customer: 

Yes, please. Anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Sure thing! Let me go over a few tips that may help improve your streaming quality. First, make sure that your device is connected to a stable internet connection with sufficient bandwidth. Also, check if there are any software updates available on your device and install them if necessary. Additionally, try restarting your device and router/modem to reset your connection if needed. Lastly, try clearing any cached data stored on your device as this can sometimes cause streaming problems as well. Does that make sense? 

Customer: 
Yes, that makes sense. Is there anything else I can do? 

 Customer Service Agent: 
Absolutely! To get the best streaming experience possible, we recommend that you use a wired connection instead of wireless if available as this will provide faster speeds and better reliability than wireless connections typically do. Additionally, try reducing any background applications running on your device as they may be causing unnecessary strain on your network connection which could affect streaming performance as well.

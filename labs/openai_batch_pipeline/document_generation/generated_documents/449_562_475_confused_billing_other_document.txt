Agent: Absolutely! I'll be happy to help you with your billing. What's the issue you're having?

Customer: Well, I'm not sure exactly what I'm being billed for. Can you tell me what services are included in my plan?

Agent: Sure. Your Contoso Wireless plan includes unlimited talk, text and data as well as access to our nationwide 4G LTE network. Is there anything else you need help with?

Customer: Yeah, I was wondering if there were any other products or services that Contoso Wireless offers that I could add to my plan.

Agent: Absolutely! We offer a variety of products and services that you can add to your plan. We have international calling plans, family plans, mobile hotspot plans and more. Do any of those sound like something you'd be interested in? 

Customer: Yeah, I think the mobile hotspot plan would be great. Can you tell me a bit more about it? 

Agent: Sure! The mobile hotspot plan gives you access to a secure Wi-Fi connection whenever you're on the go. You can use it to connect up to 10 devices at once and it comes with unlimited data. It's a great way to stay connected while you're traveling or just out and about. 

Customer: That sounds great! What's the cost of the mobile hotspot plan? 

Agent: The mobile hotspot plan costs $15 per month and it comes with unlimited data. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in adding to your plan? 

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. How do I go about adding it to my plan? 

Agent: Adding the mobile hotspot plan is easy! All you have to do is log into your account online or through our app and select the option to add a new service or product. From there, just follow the prompts and select the mobile hotspot plan from the list of available services and products. 

Customer: Got it! That sounds easy enough. Thanks for all your help! 

Agent: No problem! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

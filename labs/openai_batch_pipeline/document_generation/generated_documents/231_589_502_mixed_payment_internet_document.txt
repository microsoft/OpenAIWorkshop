Customer: Hello, I am calling because I need to discuss my payment for the Contoso Wireless internet service.

Agent: Hi there, how can I help you?

Customer: Well, I'm confused about the billing structure. I was told that the internet service would be one flat fee, but now it looks like there are extra fees tacked on every month. Can you explain this to me?

Agent: Absolutely. Contoso Wireless offers a flat fee for the internet service, but there are also additional fees associated with certain features or services that may be added on. Is there something specific that you're confused about?

Customer: Yes. I was under the impression that the flat fee would cover everything related to the internet service, but it looks like there are separate fees for different things like data usage and equipment rental. Is this correct?

Agent: That is correct. The flat fee covers your basic internet access, but any additional features or services may incur additional fees. For example, if you rent equipment from us, you will be charged a rental fee each month. If you go over your data limit, you may also be charged extra for that. 

Customer: That's what I thought. So why wasn't this made clear when I signed up for the service? 

Agent: We apologize for any confusion caused by the billing structure. We do try to make sure all of our customers are aware of all applicable fees when they sign up for our services. Unfortunately, it is possible that some information may have been overlooked in your case. 

Customer: Alright, so what can you do to help me out here? 

Agent: We understand your concern and we would like to offer you a discount on your monthly bill as a gesture of goodwill. We can reduce your monthly bill by 10% for the next three months if that helps. 

Customer: That would be great! How do I go about taking advantage of this offer? 

Agent: All you need to do is contact our customer service team and let them know that you'd like to take advantage of this offer. They will be able to provide you with more details and help you get set up with the discount. 

Customer: Perfect! That sounds like just what I need. Thank you for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can do for you today?

    "summary": "\n\nThe customer was having issues with their tv purchased from Contoso Wireless, which wasn't displaying any images when turned on. The agent suggested unplugging the power cable and performing a factory reset, but these did not resolve the issue. The agent then informed the customer that they could take advantage of Contoso Wireless' free repair or replacement service by bringing their tv into one of their stores with a valid proof of purchase. If the issue is determined to be caused by user error or accidental damage, then free repair or replacement may not be offered.",

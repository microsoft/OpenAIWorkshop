    "summary": "\n\nIn this conversation, the customer had been experiencing slow internet speeds and frequent disconnects for about a week. The agent asked the customer what kind of device they were using and then asked them to do an internet speed test. After the customer ran the test and reported the results, the agent took a look at their account information to see if there were any changes that could be made to improve their connection speed. The agent also asked the customer if they had recently changed any settings on their device or account, as this could affect their connection speed. The agent then reassured the customer that they would do their best to get the issue sorted out so that they could enjoy faster internet speeds again soon.",

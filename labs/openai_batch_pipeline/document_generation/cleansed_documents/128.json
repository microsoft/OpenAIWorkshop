The agent provided assistance by asking for more details about the customer's account and then explained that when the customer downgraded their service, they did not select the proper package for their needs. The agent then offered several different packages depending on the customer's needs, including a 10GB data plan for $50 per month that lasts for 30 days and will automatically renew at the end of each month unless cancelled or changed.",

    "The ChatGPT and GPT-4 models are optimized for conversational interfaces and work differently than the older GPT-3 models. They are conversation-in and message-out, and require input formatted in a specific chat-like transcript format. Azure OpenAI provides two different options for interacting with these models: Chat Completion API and Completion API with Chat Markup Language (ChatML). \n",
    "The Chat Completion API is the preferred method for accessing these models, while ChatML provides lower level access but requires additional input validation and only supports ChatGPT models. It's important to use the techniques described in the article to get the best results from the new models.\n",
